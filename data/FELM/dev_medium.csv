"Is the query ""Of the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic"" accurately addressed by the response (which has been split into a list of text segments) ""1. To find the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic, we need to first determine how many cars are semi-automatic. 2. We know that there are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:




20 - 12 - 4 = 4




 3. So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars out of 20 in total. To find the percentage, we can use the formula:




( Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars ) x 100%




 4. Plugging in the numbers, we get:




( 4 / 20 ) x 100% = 20%




 5. Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."" ? Generate an answer detailing the accuracy of each individual segment, e.g., 1. True; 2.

"Is the query ""Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat"" accurately addressed by the response (which has been split into a list of text segments) ""1. Let's start by figuring out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. 2. We know he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so if it takes 75 large beans to fill him up, it would take 150 medium-sized beans to fill him up.




 3. Now we need to figure out how many small beans are equivalent to one medium-sized bean. We know that 3 small beans is the same as 1 medium-sized bean, so we can set up a proportion:




3 small beans = 1 medium-sized bean
x small beans = 150 medium-sized beans




 4. Cross-multiplying, we get:




3x = 150
x = 50

If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher, which is 12 inches. 2. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. 3. And Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, which is 10 x 48 = 480 inches. 4. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:
