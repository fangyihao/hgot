"Is the query ""Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth"" accurately addressed by the response (which has been split into a list of text segments) ""1. Let's start by setting up equations based on the information given.  2. Let's say Brooke's age is ""B"" and Seth's age is ""S"".  3. From the first sentence, we know that: 




S = 2B 




 4. From the second sentence, we know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: 




(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 




 5. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 




(B + 2) + (2B + 2 + 2) = 28 




 6. Simplifying: 




3B + 6 = 28 




 7. Subtracting 6 from both sides: 




3B = 22 




 8. Dividing by 3: 




B = 7.33 




 9. Since we can't have a fraction of a year for someone's age, we'll round up to 8. 




 10. Now we can use the first equation to find Seth's age: 




S = 2B 




S = 2(8)

"Is the query ""A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce"" accurately addressed by the response (which has been split into a list of text segments) ""1. Let's start by finding out how many toys the first 2 workers produce in 10 hours. 2. 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour, so in 10 hours they produce: 




2 workers x 6 toys per hour x 10 hours = 120 toys 




 3. Similarly, the other 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour, so in 10 hours they produce: 




2 workers x 4 toys per hour x 10 hours = 80 toys 




 4. Together, the first 4 workers produce: 




120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys 




 5. Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order, we know that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is: 




400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys 




 6. We already know that the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, so the fifth worker must have produced: 




380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys 




 7. To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produced, we can divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 




180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour
