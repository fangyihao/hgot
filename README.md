# HGOT: Hierarchical Graph of Thoughts for Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning in Factuality Evaluation
With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in numerous applications, the challenge of factuality and the propensity for hallucinations has emerged as a significant concern. To address this issue, particularly in retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection, which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking. Experiments indicate that HGOT excels as a versatile approach, outperforming competing models in FEVER by up to 7% and matching leading models such as Retrieve-then-Read in Open-SQuAD, and DSP in HotPotQA, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing LLMs' factuality.

## Features

**Planner (Reasoner):** Breaks down complex queries into manageable sub-questions (sub-goals) and identifies their interdependencies.

**Thought Quality:** HGOT selects the best answer using a voting mechanism that assesses thought quality with citation recall and precision metrics.

**Retrieval Quality:** Provides a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages based on citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and retrieval module ranking.

**Evaluation Platform:** An extensible framework that evaluates HGOT's performance across multiple metrics (e.g., Exact Match and F1), using various LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek-R1 models), diverse retrieval models (e.g., Google and ColBERT), and a range of datasets (e.g., FEVER, Open-SQuAD, HotPotQA), with an emphasis on sampling from the extremes of the distribution.

**Web-based Inspection Panel:** Inspects LLM generation, confidence, latency, retrieval quality, citation quality, and the Planner (Reasoner)â€™s ability to deduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts.

#### Language Model Configuration
Currently, HGOT supports various models, including OpenAI's GPT series (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o1, o1-mini, o3-mini), Llama models (e.g., llama3.3:70b), Qwen models (e.g., qwen2.5:7b, qwen2.5:14b, qwen2.5:32b, qwen2.5:72b), and DeepSeek-R1 models (e.g., deepseek-r1:7b, deepseek-r1:8b, deepseek-r1:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, deepseek-r1:70b, deepseek-r1:671b).

To configure the language model for the web-based user interface, navigate to `config/config.json` and update the "lm" value with one of the supported language models listed above.
```
{
	"rm":"google",
	"lm":"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
	"lm_max_tokens":300
}
```
