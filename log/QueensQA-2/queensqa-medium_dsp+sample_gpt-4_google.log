...................................assistant...................................
The query is asking whether a gift card can be used to purchase an item that is already discounted. The response mentions that gift cards cannot be combined with certain discounts (Sweat Collective or Military and First Responder) for online transactions, but can be used in store. However, the response does not specifically address whether a gift card can be used on an item that is already discounted outside of these specified discounts.

...................................assistant...................................
The query is asking whether a gift card can be used to purchase items that are already discounted. The response explains that gift cards cannot be combined with certain discounts for online orders, but can be used in store. However, the response doesn't directly address if a gift card can be used on items that are already discounted. It only explains the restrictions with certain discounts such as Sweat Collective or Military and First Responder discount. Thus, the response does not accurately address the query.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The query is asking whether a gift card can be used to purchase an item that is already discounted. The response explains the limitations of using gift cards with other specific discounts (Sweat Collective or Military and First Responder discount) and that gift cards can be used in store.
