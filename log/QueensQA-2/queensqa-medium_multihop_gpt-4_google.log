The question is asking if a gift card can be used to purchase items that are already discounted. The response provides information about the limitations of using gift cards in combination with certain discounts, specifically the Sweat Collective or Military and First Responder discount. It also mentions that these limitations apply to online transactions, but not in-store purchases. Therefore, the response does provide relevant information to the question, although it does not directly confirm if a gift card can be used on already discounted items.

The first source mentions that expedited or overnight deliveries cannot be guaranteed to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes, implying that such services may be available for other locations. The second source mentions a 6 business day delivery guarantee, which could be interpreted as a form of expedited shipping. However, neither source explicitly confirms or denies the availability of expedited shipping from Lululemon.

The question is asking if Lululemon offers expedited shipping. The response states that Lululemon does not offer expedited shipping, but it does offer free standard shipping and in-store pick up. However, the context [3] contradicts the response by stating that Lululemon does offer express shipping for $5. Therefore, the response does not accurately address the query.
