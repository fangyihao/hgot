Source [2] also discusses checking your order status by going to the ORDER STATUS page, logging into your account, and entering the tracking number for your order. However, neither source directly confirms that the link https://shop.lululemon.com/help/track-order is the correct location to check an order or return status.

Question: What is Lululemon's policy for wrong orders?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Neither source [1] nor [2] provides specific information about lululemon's policy for wrong orders. Therefore, we cannot deduce the correct response from the provided context.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources provided do not specifically address the policy for wrong orders at Lululemon. They discuss the general return policy, which allows returns of full-priced items within 30 days if they are in new and original condition with tags attached. However, this may not apply to wrong orders, which could involve items the customer did not intend to purchase. Without more specific information, we cannot accurately answer the question.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context does not provide specific information on Lululemon's policy for wrong orders. It only mentions the general return policy for full-priced products within 30 days. Without explicit details on how Lululemon handles wrong orders, we cannot provide an accurate answer.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources provided do not directly address the question about Lululemon's policy for wrong orders. They only provide information on the general return policy, which states that full-priced products can be returned within 30 days for a refund in the original form of payment if they are in new and original condition. However, it is not specifically mentioned how they handle wrong orders.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to understand what is meant by "wrong orders". It could mean that the customer received an item they didn't order, or it could mean that the customer made a mistake when placing their order. Neither [1] nor [2] provide specific information on how Lululemon handles these situations. Therefore, we cannot accurately answer this question based on the provided sources.

Answer: Information not available
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources provided do not directly address the policy for wrong orders at Lululemon. They only mention the return policy for full-priced products within 30 days and the condition the item must be in for a refund. We cannot make a definitive statement about the policy for wrong orders based on this information.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources provided do not directly address the policy for wrong orders. While they do discuss the return policy within 30 days, they do not specify what happens in the case of a wrong order. Therefore, we cannot provide an accurate answer based on these sources.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources provided do not contain specific information about Lululemon's policy for wrong orders. We can infer from the general return policy that wrong orders can likely be returned within 30 days for a refund if the item is in new and original condition with tags attached, but this does not directly address the question about wrong orders.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources provided do not explicitly address the policy for wrong orders. However, they do highlight that full-priced products can be returned within 30 days for a refund, as long as they are in new and original condition with the rip tag and product tag attached. Therefore, it can be inferred that if a customer receives a wrong order, they should be able to return it within 30 days as per the general return policy. 

Answer: Return within 30 days.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources provided do not contain information about Lululemon's policy for wrong orders specifically. They only discuss the general return policy which allows returns of full-priced products within 30 days in their original condition. This might apply to wrong orders as well, but without explicit information, we cannot definitively say.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources do not provide explicit information on Lululemon's policy for wrong orders. However, they do mention that full-priced products can be returned within 30 days for a refund if they are in new and original condition.

However, without explicit information on how Lululemon handles wrong orders, we cannot definitively answer this question.

Answer: Information not provided.

The sources provided do not directly address Lululemon's policy for wrong orders. However, they do mention a 30-day return policy for full-priced products that are in new and original condition.

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context provided doesn't offer specific information about the website link https://shop.lululemon.com/help/track-order. However, since the link contains the words "track order", we can deduce that it is a page where customers can track their orders from Lululemon. This is further supported by the title provided in Context [1]: "Track your Order or Return | Check the status of your order or return here."

Answer: Order tracking page for Lululemon.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context provides information about tracking orders or returns. The link https://shop.lululemon.com/help/track-order appears to be a place where customers can check the status of their lululemon orders or returns. 

Answer: It's a lululemon order tracking page.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The given context [1] suggests that the provided URL is a page where customers can check the status of their orders or returns. However, the context [2] is not directly relevant because it refers to a different website (Lulu.com) and not the lululemon site mentioned in the question.

Answer: It's an order tracking page.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking for a brief description of the webpage at https://shop.lululemon.com/help/track-order. Given the URL, it's likely that this webpage is a part of Lululemon's official website, specifically a page that provides help or information about how to track an order. The sources provided do not give specific information about this webpage. Therefore, a general deduction would be that this is a Lululemon's page where customers can track their orders or returns.

Answer: Lululemon's order tracking page.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context [1] provides a direct reference to the URL asked in the question. It clearly states that the website link is a place where you can track your order or return. As for context [2], it doesn't provide specific information about the provided URL, but it does generally talk about tracking orders, which aligns with the purpose of the URL in question.

Answer: It's for tracking orders or returns.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The source [1] indicates that this link leads to a page where you can track your order or return. This suggests that the page provides information on how to track the status of an order or a return.

Answer: It's an order tracking page.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The query asks for a brief talk about a specific link, which is supposed to be related to tracking an order from Lululemon based on the URL. From the available sources, [1] seems to be related as it talks about tracking an order or return. However, we don't have specific information about the contents of the given URL. Therefore, we can't confidently address the query accurately.

Answer: Insufficient information
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The query is asking for a brief description or explanation of the webpage at the provided link, https://shop.lululemon.com/help/track-order.

The sources provided contain information about lululemon's return policy.

The product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached if applicable, in the original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase.

Therefore, if a customer received a wrong order from lululemon, they would be able to return it following the guidelines provided in these sources.

First, let's look at the sources. Source [1] mentions that returns can be made online by mail or in person at the closest store location, but not at outlet stores. Products must be unworn, unwashed, with hang tags attached, in original packaging, and with proof of purchase. Source [2] also says that online orders can be returned online or in-store. Now, although it doesn't specifically say 'wrong order', it is reasonable to infer that if you received a wrong order, you could return it following these policies.

Both sources [1] and [2] indicate that returns can be made either online or in person at a store.

It also mentions that the product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, if applicable, in original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase.

Both sources [1] and [2] state that returns can be made either online or at a store.

However, it specifically mentions that returns cannot be processed at Lululemon outlet stores. The product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, if applicable, in original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. Source [2] also corroborates this information, stating that online orders can be returned online or in store. Therefore, if the wrong order was made online, it can be returned following these guidelines.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context [1] and [2] mentions that returns can be made online, by mail or in person at the nearest store location. This suggests that if an order is wrong, it can be returned following these methods. However, it's important to note from context [1] that the return can't be processed at lululemon outlet stores and the product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, if applicable, in original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The information in both sources [1] and [2] states that returns can be made online or in store. If an order is wrong, it can be interpreted as an item that the customer did not intend to purchase or a product that did not meet their expectations. As such, the customer is allowed to return it according to lululemon's return policy.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we check the context given. Both [1] and [2] mention that returns can be made both online and in-store. However, it's also mentioned in [1] that the product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, if applicable, in original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. This implies that if the order is wrong but meets these conditions, it should be returnable. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking if a wrong order can be returned at Lululemon. Both sources [1] and [2] mention that returns can be made in store or online, with [1] specifically stating that returns can't be processed at Lululemon outlet stores. However, neither source directly addresses whether a "wrong order" can be returned. We can reasonably infer that a wrong order would fall under the general return policy, but without specific information on this situation, we can't definitively confirm this.

Answer: Likely Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
From the context, we can deduce that a customer can return an order at lululemon. The sources indicate that returns can be made online by mail or in person at the nearest store location. However, the returns cannot be processed at lululemon outlet stores. The product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, if applicable, in original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. Therefore, if a customer has received a wrong order, based on these conditions, they should be able to return it at lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Both sources [1] and [2] mention that returns can be made either online or in-store. However, only source [1] specifies that the product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, in its original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. This implies that as long as these conditions are met, any order, including a wrong one, could be returned. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Both sources [1] and [2] mention that returns can be made either online or in store. Source [1] further specifies that returns can be made at the closest store location, but not at outlet stores. It also mentions that the product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, in its original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. This suggests that if you received a wrong order, you should be able to return it, provided it meets these conditions.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Both sources [1] and [2] indicate that returns can be made both online and in-store. Source [1] specifies that the product must be unworn and unwashed, with tags attached, and accompanied by a proof of purchase. Source [2] also mentions that store purchases can be returned by contacting lululemon. From these details, we can deduce that a wrong order can be returned at Lululemon, provided it meets the specified conditions.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, I looked at the Context [1] and [2]. Both sources indicate that returns can be made online or in store. Context [1] specifies that the product must be unworn and unwashed, with the hang tags attached, in original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. While the question does not specify the condition of the 'wrong order', it is reasonable to assume that it would meet these conditions. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Both sources [1] and [2] mention that returns can be made both online and in-store. However, it is specified in source [1] that returns can't be processed at lululemon outlet stores. Therefore, if the wrong order was made, it can be returned either online or at a regular lululemon store, not an outlet store.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Based on the context provided, it is mentioned in [1] that returns can be made online by mail or in person at the closest store location. This indicates that if a wrong order is received, it can be returned. However, it is also specified that returns can't be processed at lululemon outlet stores. In [2], it is reiterated that online orders can be returned online or in store.

Context:
[1] «Buy online pick up in-store | On the product page, check if “buy online, pick up at store” is available near you. Once you check out, your order confirmation will include pickup instructions ...»
[2] «Curbside Pickup | Contact-free shopping with curbside pick up available at select stores (for now). Shop online and pick up your order at your local store on the same day.»

Question: Can you place an order online and pick it up in-store at Lululemon?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at the information provided in the sources. Source [1] mentions that you can check if “buy online, pick up at store” is available near you on the product page and that your order confirmation will include pickup instructions. This implies that it is possible to place an order online and pick it up in-store. Similarly, Source [2] talks about contact-free shopping with curbside pick up available at select stores, and that you can shop online and pick up your order at your local store on the same day. This further confirms that you can place an order online and pick it up in-store at Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------

First, the information provided in the context refers to different methods of contacting Lululemon, including live chat, Apple Messages, phone, or email.

The context [1] mentions that you can view your balance when checking out on lululemon.com or on the lululemon App. It also states that you can visit lululemon.com and navigate to “My Account – Profile,” then scroll down to check your balance. However, it does not explicitly state that you can check your balance by adding your gift card to your profile in the lululemon App. 

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] mentions that you can view your balance when checking out on lululemon.com or on the lululemon App. This implies that the balance can be checked through the app, but it does not explicitly mention if you need to add your gift card to your profile. However, the same source also mentions that if your Gift Card is loaded on your profile, you can go to lululemon.com and navigate to “My Account – Profile,” then scroll down to check your balance. This suggests that adding the gift card to your profile could be a prerequisite for checking the balance, both on the website and likely on the app as well.

Answer: Yes

The first source mentions that you can view your balance when checking out on lululemon.com or on the lululemon App. It also mentions that if your gift card is loaded on your profile, you can navigate to “My Account – Profile,” then scroll down to check your balance.

This implies that you can indeed add your gift card to your profile and check its balance, and it seems reasonable to infer that this would be true on the lululemon app as well.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that you can view your balance when checking out on lululemon.com or on the lululemon App, which implies that the balance can be checked through the app. However, it doesn't explicitly mention that you can add your gift card to your profile in the app to check the balance.

Answer: Gift cards can be redeemed both online and in-store, but not in concession stores.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, the given link is presumably a page on the lululemon website where one could find information about redeeming gift cards at lululemon. Secondly, the context provided suggests that gift cards can be redeemed both online and in-store. However, gift cards are not accepted in concession stores (or shop-in-shops). Finally, physical Gift Cards, eGift cards, and Gift Card barcodes in the lululemon App can all be used for redemption. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking for a brief description of what information can be found at the provided URL, which is presumably a link to lululemon's webpage on how to redeem gift cards. The context provided gives some clues as to what we might find there, specifically that gift cards can be redeemed both online and in-store, but are not accepted in concession stores. The context does not, however, give a full picture as it is not a direct representation of the content found at the URL in question. 

Answer: Insufficient Information
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking for a brief description or information about the mentioned URL which is supposed to be related to redeeming a gift card at Lululemon. The given sources [1] and [2] both talk about redeeming a gift card both in-store and online. None of the sources provide information about the specific URL mentioned in the question. Therefore, without the actual content of the URL, it's not possible to provide an accurate brief.

Answer: Insufficient Information
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question asks for a brief description of the linked page. We can infer that the page likely contains information about how to redeem a gift card at lululemon, based on the URL. The context provided confirms this, discussing both online and in-store redemption of gift cards, as well as mentioning certain exclusions.

Answer: The page is about redeeming lululemon gift cards.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The query is about providing a brief on the webpage "https://shop.lululemon.com/help/redeem-gift-card". The response does not provide any information about the webpage. Therefore, the query is not accurately addressed by the response.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking for a brief explanation or summary of the content found at the provided URL, which presumably relates to the process of redeeming a Lululemon gift card. The given responses do not provide a summary or explanation of the web page's content. Instead, they provide information on where a gift card can be redeemed, which is likely part of the information available on the web page but does not fully address the question.

Answer: No

...................................assistant...................................
The query is asking explicitly about checking the balance of a gift card. The response indeed provides information on how to check the gift card balance, by downloading the lululemon app, adding the gift card to the profile or even in-store. The provided link in the response also seems to be relevant as it navigates to a 'redeem-gift-card' page, which may offer further details on the process. Therefore, the response accurately addresses the query.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------

The response includes instructions on how to check the gift card balance by adding it to a profile on the lululemon app, and also mentions the option of redeeming the gift card in-store.

If the source [1] and the URL mentioned in the question actually provide information about the services offered on the Lululemon website, we would expect to find details about online and in-store services, and possibly about the lululemon Membership.

...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify what the question is asking for. It wants a brief overview of the services offered on the Lululemon website. Looking at the given context, the first source seems to provide information about the services provided by Lululemon. It states that the site is a "one-stop-shop" for online and in-store services and implies that it includes membership perks. The second source does not provide detailed information about services, but rather about the products offered by Lululemon. Therefore, the answer should be based on the first source.

The first source [1] gives us the information that for lettered sizes, waist and hip measurements should be used as a guide to select the right size. It also says that for numbered sizes, lululemon pants fit like your favorite chinos. So if you know your size in chinos, you can use that to select your lululemon pants. The second source [2] suggests booking an appointment with an educator if size charts are not your thing, which could be another way to select the right size.

Answer: Use waist and hip measurements.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at the information provided in the context. Context [1] provides information on how to select the size of Lululemon pants based on waist size. It says that for lettered sizes, the waist and hip measurements should be used as a guide to pick the right size. For numbered sizes, Lululemon pants fit like your favorite chinos. If you're a 32 in the pants you have at home, you'll likely be a 32 in Lululemon pants. Context [2] does not provide information specific to waist size, but it does mention that a size guide is available and appointments with an educator can be booked for more assistance. 

Based on this, the response to the question "How to select Lululemon's bottom sizes based off waist size?" would be to use the waist and hip measurements as a guide for lettered sizes, and to compare with the size of pants you have at home for numbered sizes.

Answer: Use waist and hip measurements.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------

The context provided does not include specific information about this webpage, but it does include some general information about Lululemon's "Buy Now Pay Later" program, powered by Afterpay, Klarna, and Sezzle. However, without specific details from the webpage itself, we can't determine whether the response accurately addresses the question.

However, without direct information from the requested link, an accurate factoid response cannot be provided.

Answer: Insufficient information.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to understand what the link is about. Given the context provided in sources [1] and [2], it can be inferred that the link is related to Lululemon's installment payment program allowing customers to buy now and pay later. The program is powered by Afterpay, Klarna, and Sezzle, enabling customers to make purchases and pay in installments over a certain period. Since the question asks about a specific link, the question is accurately addressed if the response provides a summary of the installment payments program at Lululemon.

Answer: No

The context provided doesn't include any direct information from that specific page, but it does mention that Lululemon offers buy now pay later options through Afterpay, Klarna, and Sezzle, which can be paid in 4 installments over 6 weeks. So, while the context gives us some information about Lululemon's buy now pay later options, it doesn't directly address the specific page the question asks about.

Answer: No

However, the query asks for specific information about the webpage at https://shop.lululemon.com/story/installment-payments-buy-now-pay-later, which is not directly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, without more specific information from the webpage in question, we can't accurately address the query.

Question: Do you need to fill out a return authorization form for Lululemon?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that to return an item to lululemon, you need to fill out a Performance Return request form and submit it for review. Therefore, it can be deduced that a form is required to initiate the return process.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source explains that to return an item to lululemon, you need to fill out a Performance Return request form. It does not mention a 'return authorization form'. The second source is a post on Reddit where a user mentions that they are missing a 'Return Authorization Form' and is unsure of what to do. The user's mention of the form suggests that it may be a part of the return process at lululemon, but the post does not provide a definitive answer. Based on the first source, it seems that a form needs to be filled out for returns, but it's not clear if this is the 'return authorization form' referred to in the question. Therefore, the answer should be 'Unclear'.

Answer: Unclear
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we check the context provided. From source [1], it mentions "Fill out a Performance Return request form to get started". This implies that a form needs to be filled out for the return process. In source [2], there's a question about a missing return authorization form, which further suggests the existence of such a form in the return process. Therefore, based on these two pieces of information, we can deduce that a return authorization form is needed for Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, we should look at the context provided. Context [1] mentions a "Performance Return request form" that needs to be filled out and submitted for any returns. Therefore, this suggests that a form is required for returns at lululemon. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at the information provided in the context. Source [1] states, "Fill out a Performance Return request form to get started." This implies that a form is required to initiate the return process. Therefore, based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that a return authorization form is indeed needed for a return at Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the context [1] mentions that you need to "fill out a Performance Return request form" to start the return process for lululemon. This indicates that there is a form that needs to be filled out when you want to return an item. Furthermore, the context [2] talks about a missing "Return Authorization Form," which implies that this form is part of the return process. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that you need to fill out a return authorization form for Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
From source [1], it is clear that a Performance Return request form needs to be filled out and submitted for a return at Lululemon. This is corroborated by source [2], which mentions a Return Authorization Form, implying that a form is needed for the return process.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that a customer needs to fill out a Performance Return request form to initiate a return process. This indicates that some form of return authorization form is required. Therefore, based on this information, it can be deduced that the answer is yes.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] mentions that to make a return, one has to fill out a "Performance Return request form". The second source [2] talks about a "Return Authorization Form" but it does not specify if it's a requirement for all returns to Lululemon. However, given that the first source specifies that a form (the "Performance Return request form") needs to be filled out, it can be inferred that some kind of form is needed for returns.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions a "Performance Return request form" that needs to be filled out when starting a return process with lululemon. This form requires photos of the item to be returned and will be reviewed by lululemon. The second source also mentions a "Return Authorization Form," although it's not clear if this is the same as the "Performance Return request form." However, both sources suggest that some form is needed to initiate a return with lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that to start a return process with Lululemon, one needs to fill out a Performance Return request form. This implies that there is a form that needs to be filled out as part of the return process. Therefore, it can be deduced that a return authorization form is required for Lululemon returns.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] mentions that to start a return with lululemon, you need to fill out a "Performance Return request form". This implies that some type of form is indeed required to initiate a return. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, source [1] mentions that for a return, one needs to fill out a Performance Return request form and submit it, along with photos of the item they want to send back. Then, Lululemon will review the request and respond. Secondly, source [2] talks about a situation where a return authorization form is missing, indicating that such a form is usually part of the return process. Therefore, based on both sources, it seems that yes, you do need to fill out a return authorization form for Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that to return a product to Lululemon, one needs to fill out a Performance Return request form and attach photos of the item they want to send back. The company will then review the request and respond in 12-15 business days. The second source is a Reddit post where a user is asking about a missing return authorization form, further suggesting that such a form is needed. Therefore, it can be deduced that a return authorization form is indeed required for returns to Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
In source [1], it states that you need to "Fill out a Performance Return request form to get started." This implies that a form is needed to initiate a return with lululemon. Therefore, it would be accurate to say that a return authorization form is required for a return.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions filling out a "Performance Return request form" to start the return process for lululemon. It states that you have to submit the form and attach photos of the item you want to return. After reviewing your request, lululemon will respond within 12 – 15 business days. If your request is approved, they'll email you an e-gift card. The second source also talks about a "Return Authorization Form" and wonders if they need to reach out to GEC (Guest Education Centre) or attach return details in the absence of the form. Given the information from both sources, it can be inferred that a form is needed to initiate the return process for lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that one must fill out a Performance Return request form to start the return process. It further explains that Lululemon will review this request, and if approved, the customer will receive an e-gift card. The second source is a Reddit thread where a user is asking about a missing Return Authorization Form. The user is considering reaching out to the Guest Education Centre (GEC) or attaching the return details in another way. This implies that a return form is typically needed. Therefore, based on the information from these sources, it seems you do need to fill out a return authorization form for Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we see from source [1] that there is a process called a "Performance Return" which requires filling out a request form. It is not stated explicitly that this is the only return process available, but it is a strong implication. Also, in source [2], a user is inquiring about a missing return authorization form, suggesting that such a form is usually part of the return process. From these two pieces of information, it seems likely that a form is indeed required for returns to Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] states that to initiate a return, one needs to fill out a Performance Return request form. However, this source does not mention specifically a "return authorization form". The second source [2] includes a discussion about a missing "Return Authorization Form". Therefore, it can be inferred that a form is indeed required for returns, although it's not explicitly referred to as "return authorization form" in the first source. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that you need to fill out a Performance Return request form to get started if you want to return an item. The second source is a Reddit post where someone is asking about a missing Return Authorization Form. Combining the information from both sources, it can be deduced that a form is indeed required to initiate a return for Lululemon.

The sources don't provide specific information about a return authorization form. They discuss general return and refund laws in the U.S., stating that if a retailer does not post a return policy, they must accept returns within 20 days [1] or 30 days [2].

Neither of the provided sources [1] or [2] mention anything about a return authorization form. As such, they don't provide the necessary information to answer the question, and any answer would only be speculation.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context does not directly address a return authorization form. However, it does mention that if a store does not post a return policy, the law requires the store to accept returns within 30 days. Therefore, it can be inferred that the return authorization form would likely allow for this 30-day return period.

Answer: Likely yes.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to verify if the return authorization form allows for returns within 30 days. However, the context provided doesn't mention a return authorization form at all. The context only discusses general return and refund laws in the U.S., stating that if a retailer doesn't post a return policy, they are required to accept returns within 30 days. But without specific information about the return authorization form in question, we cannot accurately answer this question.

Answer: Information not available
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking whether a return authorization form permits return of a purchase within a 30-day window. Neither [1] nor [2] specifically mention a return authorization form. Both sources do, however, mention that if a store does not post any return policy, it is legally required to accept returns within 30 days. This suggests that, absent a specific policy, a 30-day return window may be standard. However, without more specific information about the return authorization form in question, it's not possible to definitively answer the question.

Answer: Unknown
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to determine the specific return policy mentioned in the question. The question refers to a return authorization form, but the context does not provide any information about a specific form. However, the context does mention that if a store does not post a return policy, the law requires it to accept returns within 30 days. Therefore, if the store has not posted any return policy, it must accept returns within this timeframe. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the question refers to a "return authorization form" which is not mentioned in any of the sources, so we cannot determine its specifics. However, both sources do mention a general guideline that if a store does not explicitly post its return policy, it is required to accept returns within 30 days. Given these facts, we can infer that, generally, a return should be allowed within 30 days if there is no explicit policy against it.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking whether a return authorization form allows for returns within a 30-day period. However, the context provided does not mention anything about a return authorization form. It only discusses general return and refund laws in the U.S and mentions that if a return policy is not posted, returns should be accepted within 20 to 30 days. However, this information does not directly answer the question about the return authorization form.

Answer: Insufficient information.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources do not provide specific information about a return authorization form. However, they do state that if a store does not post any return policy, the law requires the store to accept returns within 30 days. If the store in question does not have a posted return policy, it would be required to accept returns within 30 days, presumably with a return authorization form.

Answer: Unclear
----------------------------------- STEPS WITH ANSWERS -----------------------------------
Step 1: Why is the return authorization form important? ANSWER: For tracking and customer satisfaction.
Step 2: Does the return authorization form allow you to return your purchase within 30 days? ANSWER: Information not available.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify the question being asked, which is about the importance of a return authorization form. Next, we look at the response provided which states that the return authorization form allows for the return of a purchase within 30 days. This response does not accurately address the question as it does not explain the importance of a return authorization form, which according to source [1] is to allow for tracking and accountability during the return or exchange process. Therefore, the response does not accurately address the query.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question asks why a return authorization form is important. The response, however, only explains the return policy and the duration (30 days) within which a purchase can be returned. It does not explain why the return authorization form, specifically, is important. The response fails to mention that the return authorization form, often called RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization), is key for tracking and accountability throughout the return or exchange process, as stated in source [1]. Therefore, the response does not accurately address the query.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the question is asking why a return authorization form is important, not about the time frame for returning a purchase.

In the context [1], it is mentioned that a return authorization form, or RMA, serves as a reference for tracking and accountability throughout the return or exchange process and is important for customer satisfaction. However, the response given does not mention these points but instead talks about the return time frame. Therefore, the response does not accurately address the query.

Context:
[1] «Quality Promise | lululemon athletica | If our product doesn't perform for you, we'll take it back. While we pride ourselves on creating long-lasting gear, our quality promise does not cover usage beyond practical lifetime, and as a result our Quality Promise cannot be applied to any item purchased through Like New., If our product doesn't perform for you, we'll take it back»
[2] «Return Policies | lululemon athletica | Purchases made within 30 days can be returned or exchanged, subject to the terms and conditions below. For an exchange, please visit your local lululemon store.»

Question: Can you return a Lululemon product if you are not happy with its performance?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question asks whether a customer can return a lululemon product if they're not satisfied with how it performs. Source [1] states that if a lululemon product does not perform to the customer's satisfaction, lululemon will take it back as part of their Quality Promise. Therefore, the response to the query is in the affirmative.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we see in source [1] that Lululemon has a Quality Promise policy, stating "If our product doesn't perform for you, we'll take it back." This suggests that if a customer is not happy with a product's performance, they can return it. However, it also mentions that this does not cover usage beyond the product's practical lifetime. This could potentially limit returns based on performance issues that arise long after purchase. Source [2] states that purchases made within 30 days can be returned or exchanged, but it doesn't specifically mention performance as a reason for return. Given the information from these two sources, it seems that a customer can return a Lululemon product if they are not happy with its performance, as long as it is within the practical lifetime of the product and possibly within 30 days of purchase.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] clearly states "If our product doesn't perform for you, we'll take it back." This directly addresses the question about whether a Lululemon product can be returned if a customer is not happy with its performance.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] states that if a Lululemon product doesn't perform for the consumer, they'll take it back. This directly addresses the question about returning a product if one is not happy with its performance. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The source [1] states that if a Lululemon product doesn't perform for the customer, they will take it back. This suggests that if a customer is not happy with the performance of a product, they can return it. Source [2] also provides additional context, stating that purchases made within 30 days can be returned or exchanged. So, based on these two sources, it can be deduced that you can return a Lululemon product if you are not happy with its performance, as long as it is within the 30-day return period.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context [1] states, "If our product doesn't perform for you, we'll take it back." This directly addresses the question about returning a product if the customer is not happy with its performance. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first context mentions that if a Lululemon product does not perform, they will take it back. Therefore, if a customer is not happy with a product's performance, it seems they can return it. This is further supported by the second context, which confirms that purchases made within 30 days can be returned or exchanged. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The source [1] states that "If our product doesn't perform for you, we'll take it back". This information directly addresses the query about returning a product if you are not happy with its performance. Therefore, the answer to the question is "yes".

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] states that if a Lululemon product does not perform, they will take it back. This suggests that if a customer is not happy with the performance of a Lululemon product, they can return it. Therefore, the answer to the question is "Yes".

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] states that Lululemon will take back a product if it does not perform for the customer. This suggests that if a customer is not happy with the performance of a Lululemon product, they can return it. The second source [2] confirms that purchases made within 30 days can be returned or exchanged, subject to certain terms and conditions. Therefore, given these sources, it can be inferred that if a customer is not happy with the performance of a Lululemon product, they can return it, especially if the purchase was made within the last 30 days.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

Question: Can you use a Lululemon gift card to purchase something that is already discounted?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at Lululemon stores. This suggests that a Lululemon gift card can indeed be used to purchase something that is already discounted. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at source [1] that talks about the Sweat Collective Program. It mentions that gift cards cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions, but they can be used in combination with your discount at any of our stores. This implies that if you have a discounted item in a physical store, you can use your gift card to purchase it. There's no information contradicting this in Source [2], which only mentions that gift cards can be used in store or online, and never expire or depreciate.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
In source [1], it is stated that "Gift cards, Klarna, Afterpay, and PayPal cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions. Gift cards can be used in combination with your discount at any of our stores.". This means that gift cards cannot be used with other discounts for online transactions, but they can be used with discounts in physical Lululemon stores.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with discounts at Lululemon stores. However, it does not specify whether this applies to already discounted items. The second source confirms that gift cards can be used both in store and online, but does not mention anything about purchasing discounted items. However, since the first source confirms that gift cards can be combined with discounts, it is reasonable to infer that this would include already discounted items.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
From source [1], we understand that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at any of the Lululemon stores. This information directly addresses the question asking if a Lululemon gift card can be used to purchase something that is already discounted. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] states that gift cards can be used in combination with discounts at any of their stores. This implies that you can use a gift card for an already discounted item. The second source [2] also confirms that gift cards can be used in store or online, without any specific restrictions mentioned about discounted items.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at lululemon stores. This implies that a gift card can be used to purchase something that is already discounted. The second source further confirms that gift cards can be used for any purchase, as it states they can be used in store or online and never expire. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
From source [1], it is stated that "Gift cards, Klarna, Afterpay, and PayPal cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions. Gift cards can be used in combination with your discount at any of our stores." This indicates that while you cannot use a gift card with a discount for online purchases, you can use a gift card with a discount in physical stores. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at Lululemon stores. The second source confirms that gift cards can be used in store or online and they do not expire. Therefore, based on this information, it seems you can use a Lululemon gift card to purchase something that is already discounted.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the source [1] clearly states that "Gift cards, Klarna, Afterpay, and PayPal cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions." This means that if an item is already discounted, a gift card cannot be used for the purchase online. However, it also mentions that "Gift cards can be used in combination with your discount at any of our stores", which means that in physical stores, you can use a gift card to purchase something that is already discounted. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the purchase is made online or in-store.

Answer: Yes, in-store; No, online.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source [1] mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount for in-store transactions. However, they cannot be used in combination with a discount for online transactions. So, the answer depends on whether the purchase is being made in-store or online.

Answer: Yes, in-store; No, online.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at the information from the sources. Source [1] mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at any of Lululemon's stores. Source [2] confirms that gift cards can be used for purchases both in store or online. Therefore, based on these sources, it can be deduced that a Lululemon gift card can be used to purchase something that is already discounted.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, source [1] mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at Lululemon stores. However, it does not explicitly mention if this applies to online transactions. On the other hand, source [2] states that the gift cards can be used in store or online but doesn't mention anything about their usage in combination with discounts. By combining information from both sources, we can deduce that Lululemon gift cards can be used to purchase items that are already discounted.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
From source [1], we understand that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at Lululemon stores. However, the source does not mention whether this applies to online transactions. Source [2] simply confirms that gift cards can be used in-store or online, but it does not provide information about whether they can be used with discounted items. Therefore, based on the available information, we can deduce that gift cards can be used in combination with discounted items in-store but it is unclear if this applies to online transactions.

Answer: Yes, in-store.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, Source [1] states that "Gift cards, Klarna, Afterpay, and PayPal cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions. Gift cards can be used in combination with your discount at any of our stores." This means that if you're shopping online, you cannot use a gift card to buy something that's already discounted. However, if you're shopping in a physical store, you can use a gift card to buy something that's already discounted. 

Answer: Yes, in stores. No, online.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
From source [1], we know that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at Lululemon stores. Therefore, it can be inferred that a Lululemon gift card can be used to purchase something that is already discounted.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that gift cards cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions, but they can be used in combination with a discount at any of the stores. This suggests that a Lululemon gift card can be used to purchase something that is already discounted, but only in physical stores, not online.

Answer: Yes, in stores.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with the discount for in-store transactions. However, it specifically states that gift cards cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions. The second source confirms that gift cards can be used in store or online, but does not provide any information regarding purchasing discounted items. By analyzing these sources, we can conclude that a Lululemon gift card can be used to purchase something that is already discounted, but only for in-store transactions.

Answer: Yes, in-store only.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we have to understand what the question is asking. It wants to know if it's possible to use a Lululemon gift card on an item that is already discounted. 

Looking at the context provided, [1] mentions that "Gift cards, Klarna, Afterpay, and PayPal cannot be used in combination with the discount for online transactions. Gift cards can be used in combination with your discount at any of our stores." This implies that for online transactions, a gift card cannot be used on an item that is already discounted. However, in physical stores, gift cards can be used with discounts.

Answer: Yes, in stores. No, online.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, source [1] mentions that gift cards can be used in combination with a discount at Lululemon stores. Secondly, source [2] confirms that Lululemon gift cards can be used for purchases both in store and online. Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that a Lululemon gift card can be used to purchase something that is already discounted.

However, the response does not address whether the gift card can be used for other types of discounts. Therefore, the question is not fully addressed by the response.

Answer: No

----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that lululemon cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes. This implies that they do offer expedited shipping, but it may not be available for all locations.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that expedited or overnight deliveries cannot be guaranteed to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes. This implies that expedited or overnight deliveries are generally available, but may not be delivered as quickly to certain addresses. Therefore, it can be deduced that lululemon does offer expedited shipping.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that while lululemon does ship to P.O. boxes or rural zip codes, they cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to these locations. This suggests that expedited or overnight shipping is at least available to other locations. Therefore, the answer can be deduced from this information.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context [1] specifies that lululemon cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes. This implies that they do offer these services under normal circumstances. 

Answer: Yes

...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that while lululemon does ship to P.O. Boxes and rural zip codes, they cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to these locations. This suggests that expedited shipping is offered by lululemon, but there might be restrictions based on location.

...................................assistant...................................
The context [1] states that lululemon cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes. This implies that they do offer expedited shipping, just not to certain locations.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, the question is about whether lululemon offers expedited shipping. The first source [1] mentions shipping to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes and states that they cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to these locations. This implies that expedited and overnight shipping options are available, just not to these particular locations. The second source [2] does not provide any additional relevant details concerning expedited shipping. Therefore, based on the information provided in source [1], we can deduce that lululemon does offer expedited shipping, just not to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that they cannot "guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes". This implies that expedited and overnight deliveries are options, but they are not guaranteed to certain locations. Therefore, the answer can be inferred from this information.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that Lululemon does offer expedited shipping, but they can't guarantee this service for P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes.

The first source mentions that lululemon cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes.

...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that while Lululemon can ship to P.O. boxes and rural zip codes, they cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to these areas. This suggests that they do offer expedited shipping, but it may not be available for all locations.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first context source mentions that Lululemon cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes. This implies that under normal circumstances (i.e., not delivering to a P.O. Box or rural zip code), expedited or overnight shipping may be available.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we can see from source [1] that Lululemon does provide shipping, but it does not guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes. This implies that expedited shipping could be available for other locations. Source [2] does not provide explicit information about expedited shipping, but does mention a guarantee of 6 business day delivery, which could be a form of expedited shipping, but it's not explicitly stated. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that lululemon cannot guarantee expedited or overnight deliveries to P.O. Boxes or rural zip codes. This implies that they do offer expedited shipping, but they cannot guarantee it for certain locations. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Question: Does lululemon offer free standard shipping when you shop the We Made Too Much Sale?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to determine if lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. From source [1], we learn that this is indeed the case. Next, we need to confirm if the We Made Too Much Sale is an exception to this policy. Source [2] doesn't explicitly mention the We Made Too Much Sale, but it does state that standard shipping is free on every order. Given that the sale would fall under "every order", we can infer that it is also eligible for free standard shipping.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the question is asking specifically about the "We Made Too Much Sale" at lululemon, and whether free standard shipping is offered for purchases during this sale. From source [1], we learn that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. The same information is reiterated in source [2]. However, neither source mentions the "We Made Too Much Sale" directly. Yet, as the free shipping is stated to be applicable to all orders, it can be deduced that it would apply to the "We Made Too Much Sale" as well.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, source [2] mentions that there is a "We Made Too Much" sale at Lululemon. However, it does not explicitly say whether free standard shipping is offered for purchases from this sale. On the other hand, source [1] clearly states that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. If "all of its orders" truly means all, then it should include orders from the "We Made Too Much" sale. Therefore, based on the information provided in these sources, it is reasonable to infer that Lululemon does offer free standard shipping for purchases made during the "We Made Too Much" sale.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the question is asking for information about Lululemon's shipping policy in relation to a specific sale called the "We Made Too Much" sale. Looking at the sources provided, [1] mentions that "Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders", which is a general statement about all orders. Meanwhile, [2] reiterates that "Standard shipping is free on every order" and mentions the "We Made Too Much" sale. Although [2] does not explicitly link the two statements, the fact that both the "We Made Too Much" sale and free standard shipping are mentioned in the same context, and given the general policy stated in [1], we can deduce that the free standard shipping would apply to the "We Made Too Much" sale as well.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to establish that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all orders. This information is provided in both [1] and [2]. Next, we need to determine if the "We Made Too Much" Sale is included in all orders. As the sources do not specifically exclude the sale from all orders, we can deduce that the sale is included. Therefore, Lululemon does offer free standard shipping when you shop the We Made Too Much Sale.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we would look at the first source [1], which states that "Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders," which implies that any order placed on Lululemon, regardless of the items or sales involved, would be eligible for free standard shipping. The second source [2] doesn't provide new information on this matter but merely confirms what we found in the first source, stating that "Standard shipping is free on every order." Given this information, we can infer that shopping the We Made Too Much Sale would also include free standard shipping since it falls under "all orders."

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, source [1] informs us that "Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders". Then, source [2] reinforces this information by stating that "Standard shipping is free on every order". Neither source distinguishes between different types of sales or products, so it's reasonable to infer that the "We Made Too Much Sale" would also be included in this policy of free standard shipping.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at source [1] which mentions that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. This is a broad statement encompassing all products. Then, we cross-reference with source [2] which specifically mentions that standard shipping is free on every order during the "We Made Too Much" sale. Therefore, it can be deduced that Lululemon does offer free standard shipping when shopping the "We Made Too Much" sale.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, source [1] mentions that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. Secondly, source [2] also confirms that standard shipping is free on every order. Nowhere does it specify that this excludes the "We Made Too Much" Sale. Therefore, we can deduce that free standard shipping would also be applicable to orders from the "We Made Too Much" Sale.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify if Lululemon provides free standard shipping. From source [1] and [2], it is clear that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. However, neither source explicitly mentions the "We Made Too Much Sale". Since the question is specifically about this sale, we cannot definitively answer based on the given sources. But since both sources mention that standard shipping is free for all orders, it can be inferred that this would likely apply to the "We Made Too Much Sale" as well.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify if Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all its orders. From [1], we can confirm that Lululemon does offer free standard shipping for all of its orders. Next, we need to confirm if this applies to the "We Made Too Much" sale as well. Since the sources do not specify any exceptions to the free shipping policy, it is reasonable to assume that the "We Made Too Much" sale is included in the 'all orders' category. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, both sources [1] and [2] mention that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. This implies that regardless of the type of sale or items purchased, the standard shipping should be free. The question specifically asks about the "We Made Too Much Sale," but since the sources state that the free shipping applies to all orders, it can be inferred that the free shipping would also apply to orders from the "We Made Too Much Sale."

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking if Lululemon provides free standard shipping for items purchased during the We Made Too Much Sale. We know from [1] that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. Since the We Made Too Much Sale would be an order, it should also qualify for free standard shipping. We also know from [2] that standard shipping is free on every order, which again, would include the We Made Too Much Sale.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to confirm if Lululemon offers free standard shipping. Source [1] and [2] both confirm that Lululemon indeed offers free standard shipping for all orders. However, neither source specifically mentions the "We Made Too Much Sale". As both sources mention "all orders", it can be deduced that the "We Made Too Much Sale" should also be included in this since it is a type of order.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at the information given in source [1], which states that "Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders", and then at source [2] which confirms "Standard shipping is free on every order". The question asks if free standard shipping is offered when shopping the We Made Too Much Sale. Based on the information from both sources, it is clear that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all orders, which would include purchases from the We Made Too Much Sale.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, in source [1] it is mentioned that "Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders". This suggests that all orders, regardless of what is purchased, come with free standard shipping. Secondly, in source [2] it is specifically stated that "Standard shipping is free on every order". The question asks specifically about the "We Made Too Much Sale", however, based on the information given in the sources, it seems that all orders, including those from the sale, would have free standard shipping. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify if Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. According to [1], Lululemon does indeed offer free standard shipping for all orders. Next, we need to determine if this applies to the "We Made Too Much" Sale. Since the sale is still a part of Lululemon's offerings and no exceptions were mentioned in the context, it can be inferred that the free standard shipping offer is applicable to the sale as well.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, source [1] states that "Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders" and source [2] confirms "Standard shipping is free on every order".

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
From source [1], we learn that Lululemon offers free standard shipping for all of its orders. From source [2], we understand that standard shipping is free on every order whether it is from the "We Made Too Much" sale or not.

Question: What is the price of a tennis skirt for women in black color at Lululemon?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at the sources provided for relevant information. Source [1] mentions a high-rise wrap tennis skirt priced at $88. However, the color is not specified here. Source [2] does not provide specific pricing or color details for Lululemon tennis skirts. Therefore, the exact price of a black tennis skirt at Lululemon is not specified in the given sources.

Answer: Not specified
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify if the sources provided contain information about the price of a tennis skirt for women in black color at Lululemon. Source [1] mentions the price of a high-rise wrap tennis skirt, but it does not specify the color. Source [2] talks about deals for tennis skirts at Lululemon, but it does not provide a specific price for a black tennis skirt. Therefore, the information needed to answer the question is not provided in the sources.

Answer: Information not provided.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Firstly, the sources do not specify the color of the skirts available. Secondly, the price mentioned in source [1] is $88 for a high-rise wrap tennis skirt, but it is not specified if this price is for a black skirt. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be accurately determined what the price of a black tennis skirt at Lululemon is.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions that the price of a High-Rise Wrap Tennis Skirt is $88, but the color is not specified. The second source talks about discounts on tennis skirts but again, does not specify the color. Therefore, while we can say that the price of a tennis skirt is $88, we cannot confirm the price of a black tennis skirt specifically.

Answer: $88
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions a High-Rise Wrap Tennis Skirt for $88, but it does not specify the color. The second source mentions deals on tennis skirts, but does not provide specific prices. The question asks for the price of a tennis skirt in black color, but neither source provides this specific information. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question based on the provided sources.

Answer: Information not available.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context [1] mentions a High-Rise Wrap Tennis Skirt priced at $88. It does not specify the color, but it mentions that it is available in 4 colors. Given that black is a common color for clothing, it can be assumed that black is one of the options, but this is not explicitly stated. The color is not mentioned in context [2] either.

Answer: $88
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions a high-rise wrap tennis skirt that costs $88, but it doesn't specify the color. The second source speaks about deals for tennis skirts at Lululemon, but it also doesn't provide specific details about the color or the price of a black tennis skirt.

Answer: Information not available.

First, we look at the sources provided. Both [1] and [2] mention a "Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt" from Lululemon. Source [1] indicates that this item is priced at $88 USD, which matches the price mentioned in the question. Source [2] states that a "Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt" is available in black. Therefore, combining the information from both sources leads us to the conclusion that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is indeed available in black for $88 USD at Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the sources mention a "Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt" which matches the product in the question. Then, both sources mention the price as "$88 USD" which is the same as in the question. Finally, source [2] specifies the color as "Black" which is also what is asked in the question. Therefore, all elements of the question are confirmed by the sources.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we check the source [1], which mentions the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is priced at $88 USD. However, it does not specify the color of the skirt. Next, we refer to source [2], which mentions the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is available in black. Combining information from both sources, we can infer that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is available in black for $88 USD at Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at context [1], where it mentions the "Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt" and its price "$88 USD". However, this does not specify the color of the skirt. Then we examine context [2], which directly mentions "Women's Skirts | Black. Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt. $88". This confirms that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is indeed available in black for $88 USD.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is available for $88 USD. However, the color is not specified in the first source. The second source mentions a black skirt, but it's not clear if this is the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt. Therefore, the available information doesn't confirm that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is available in black for $88 USD at Lululemon.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the context mentions a Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt for $88 USD, which matches the item and price stated in the question. Second, the context also mentions that there is a 'Women's Skirts | Black' and then immediately mentions the 'Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt' again. Although it doesn't explicitly say that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is black, it strongly suggests it. Therefore, the answer is probably yes.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the question asks about the availability of a specific product, the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt, in a specific color, black, at a specific price, $88 USD, at Lululemon. The context provided in [1] and [2] confirms that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is indeed available for $88 USD. Additionally, [2] specifically mentions that this skirt is available in black. Therefore, the information in the context accurately addresses the question.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions a Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt available for $88 USD, but it does not specify the color. The second source, however, does mention a black Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt, but it does not specify the price. Since both conditions (black color and $88 USD price) are mentioned in different sources, it can be deduced that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is available in black for $88 USD at Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to find the name of the product in question, which is the "Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt". Source [1] mentions this exact product and states that it costs $88 USD. Source [2] confirms that a skirt named "Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt" is available in black. Therefore, synthesizing these two pieces of information, we can determine that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is indeed available in black for $88 USD at Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions a Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt priced at $88 USD, but does not specify the color. The second source, however, mentions a black skirt that matches the description and price of the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt from the first source.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to confirm that the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is available at Lululemon. Both [1] and [2] confirm that this item is available. Next, we need to check if it is available in black. [2] specifically mentions that the skirt is available in black. The last step is to verify the price, which is stated as $88 USD in both [1] and [2]. Therefore, all elements of the question have been confirmed by the provided sources.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we look at source [1], which shows a Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt being sold for $88 USD. However, the color is not specified. Then, we check source [2] which shows a black Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt being sold. The price isn't mentioned directly in [2], but it can be inferred since it's the same product as in [1]. Thus, we can conclude that a Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt in black for $88 USD is available at Lululemon.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt and its price as $88 USD. However, it does not mention the color of the skirt. The second source mentions a skirt available in black but does not specify that this is the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt. Therefore, while both the skirt and the color black are mentioned across the two sources, there is no definitive source that confirms the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt is available in black.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify the key pieces of information in the question: the specific product (Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt), color (black), price ($88 USD), and retailer (Lululemon). Next, we look at the given sources. Source [1] mentions the product, price, and retailer, but does not specify the color. Source [2] provides the missing piece of information, confirming that the skirt is available in black. Both sources also mention free delivery and a 30-day return policy, but this information is not relevant to the question. Therefore, based on the information provided in both sources, the question is accurately addressed.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The first source mentions the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt, gives its price as $88 USD, but does not mention the color. The second source mentions a skirt that is black and costs $88, but does not specify that it is the Side-Pleat High-Rise Tennis Skirt.
