Caribbean is not mentioned in the sources, so we can eliminate it as a possible answer. Chapayev is a hybrid of checkers and gamepiece-impact games, so it is possible that it involves knocking pieces off the board. Mancala games involve sowing counters and Stratego involves capturing pieces, so they are not the correct answer.

...................................assistant...................................
Ernst Messerschmid's birth date is not given in the sources. Philippe Perrin's birth date is given as January 6, 1963 in [2]. Therefore, it is impossible to determine who is older.

Answer: Cannot be determined.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Ernst Messerschmid's birth date is not given in the sources. Philippe Perrin was born on January 6, 1963, according to [2]. Therefore, Philippe Perrin is younger than Ernst Messerschmid and we cannot determine who is older.

Answer: Cannot be determined.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
We know from [2] that Philippe Perrin was born on January 6, 1963. We do not have Ernst Messerschmid's birth date, but we know from [1] that there is no information about his birth date. Therefore, we cannot determine who is older between the two.

Answer: Cannot be determined
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Ernst Messerschmid's birth date is not given in the sources. Philippe Perrin's birth date is given as January 6, 1963, in [2]. Therefore, we cannot determine who is older.

Answer: Cannot be determined.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Ernst Messerschmid's birth date is not given in the sources, so we cannot determine his age. Philippe Perrin's birth date is given as January 6, 1963 in [2], so he is younger than Messerschmid if Messerschmid was born before that date.

Caribbean and Chapayev are both board games, but only one of them involves knocking an opponent's pieces off the board. Mancala games involve sowing counters, while Stratego involves capturing the opponent's flag or pieces. Chapayev, according to sources [1] and [2], is a hybrid of checkers and gamepiece-impact games, which suggests that it may involve knocking pieces off the board. Therefore, the answer is Chapayev.

The Angels of Mons is a popular legend about a group of angels who supposedly protected members of an army. 4. The legend is specifically about the British Army during the Battle of Mons in Belgium on August 23, 1914. 5. Therefore, the army in question is the British Army.

Question: Between Caribbean and Chapayev what game had a goal of knocking an opponent's pieces off the board?

Rationale: Let's think step by step. Caribbean and Chapayev are both board games, but only one of them involves knocking an opponent's pieces off the board. Mancala games involve sowing counters, while Stratego involves capturing the opponent's flag or pieces. Chapayev, according to sources [1] and [2], is a hybrid of checkers and gamepiece-impact games, which suggests that it may involve knocking pieces off the board. Therefore, the answer is Chapayev.

Answer: Chapayev

- Therefore, The Von Bondies lasted the longest.
