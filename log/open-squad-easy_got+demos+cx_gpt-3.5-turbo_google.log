There are multiple Woodward Parks mentioned in the sources provided. We need to identify which Woodward Park is being referred to in the question. From the sources, we see that there is a Woodward Park in Fresno, California, and one in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We can eliminate the mention of Camp Woodward in Pennsylvania, as it is not a public park. We also see that the Fresno park was named after Ralph Woodward, who donated part of his estate to create a public park. The Tulsa park, on the other hand, was named after Helen Woodward, the original property owner, after a lengthy court suit over ownership. Therefore, the answer to the question "Who founded Woodward Park?" would be different depending on which park is being referred to. For the Fresno park, the founder would be Ralph Woodward, while for the Tulsa park, there is no single founder mentioned.

Pyrenoids are microcompartments within the chloroplasts of algae and hornworts that promote photosynthetic CO2 fixation. They are involved in carbon fixation and starch formation and storage. Pyrenoids can be induced by a common product of photosynthesis specific to low CO2 or hyperoxia. Blocking DNA replication using aphidicolin inhibited the formation of pyrenoids. New pyrenoid functions are supported by proteins in tetrapyrrole and chlorophyll synthesis, carotenoid metabolism, or amino acid metabolism. Therefore, pyrenoids themselves do not replicate, but their formation may rely on DNA replication.

The context is discussing the concept of identity and how it is related to being situated in a social object. It also mentions Erikson's theory of ego identity. Therefore, the context is related to psychology and social interactions.

Answer: The context is related to psychology and social interactions.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------

Answer: The context is discussing a situation where "he" has a social object identity but his personal identity is not provided.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context is discussing identity and how it is related to being situated as a social object. The question is asking for the specific situation where the identity of "he" is not provided. Therefore, we need to look for a sentence or paragraph in the context where the identity of "he" is not specified.

----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context is discussing identity and the definition of the situation. It mentions that having identity means being situated as a social object.

Answer: Social situations.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context mentions "identity" and "situation." The first source clarifies that having identity means being situated as a social object. The second source adds that our interactions with others affect our sense of self or ego identity. Therefore, the context refers to the social situation in which an individual's identity is acknowledged or shaped.

Answer: The context of the situation is the social situation in which an individual's identity is acknowledged or shaped.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context is about identity and how it is shaped by social acknowledgement. Erikson's theory of identity development suggests that interaction with others affects one's sense of self. Therefore, the situation where the identity of "he" is not provided may be related to the acknowledgement and interaction with others in shaping one's identity. 

Answer: The context of the situation where the identity of "he" is not provided is related to the acknowledgement and interaction with others in shaping one's identity.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

The context is discussing the concept of identity and situational casting. It mentions "he" as an example but does not provide further information about his identity. Therefore, the question is asking for clarification on the context of the situation where the identity is not provided.

Answer: The context is discussing the concept of identity and situational casting, but does not provide further information about the identity of the person mentioned as "he."
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking about a specific situation where the identity of "he" is not provided. The sources mention identity and its development, but it is not clear if they directly address the question. However, by combining the information from both sources, we can infer that identity is shaped by social interaction and acknowledgement. Therefore, the context of the situation where the identity of "he" is not provided could be a social setting where the person's identity is not acknowledged or recognized.

Answer: Lack of acknowledgement or recognition in a social setting.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context is discussing identity and how it is not a substitute word for "self." It also mentions being cast in the shape of a social object by acknowledgement. The second source mentions Erikson's theory that how we interact with others affects our sense of self, or ego identity. Therefore, the context is likely discussing the relationship between identity and social interactions.

Answer: Social interactions.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context is discussing identity and the definition of the situation. The statement mentions that having identity means being situated, or cast in the shape of a social object by acknowledgement.

Answer: A general situation where identity is acknowledged.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------

Answer: Social interaction.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If someone walks when their identity is not provided, it could be because they are influenced by the social context in which they are in. This could be due to social identity and self-evaluation maintenance theory. 

Answer: Social context.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If someone walks when their identity is not provided, it could be because they feel anonymous and less accountable for their actions. This is known as the "deindividuation" effect. It could also be because they are influenced by the social context in which they are in, such as a crowd or group mentality.

Answer: Deindividuation and social context can both be possible reasons for someone to walk when their identity is not provided in the context of psychology and social interactions.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, social identity refers to the part of a person's self-concept that is based on their group membership. Second, self-evaluation maintenance theory suggests that people will react to someone who outperforms them in a way that maintains their self-esteem. Third, walking away from a situation where their identity is not provided may be a way for someone to avoid the potential threat to their self-esteem.

Answer: To avoid a potential threat to their self-esteem.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to consider the concept of social identity and how it influences behavior. Then, we can look at how the social context in which actions take place can also affect behavior.

Answer: Possible reasons for someone to walk when their identity is not provided could include a desire to conform to social norms or a fear of standing out in a group.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
1. Walking when identity is not provided is a common phenomenon in psychology experiments.
2. It may be due to the presence of others and the social context.
3. The lack of social identity cues may lead to feelings of anonymity and reduced self-awareness.
4. This can lead to a decrease in self-evaluation concerns and a greater willingness to engage in non-normative behavior.

Answer: Anonymity and reduced self-awareness.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
1. Walking when identity is not provided suggests a desire to avoid social interaction.
2. This could be due to a lack of social identity or a perceived threat to one's social identity.
3. Self-evaluation maintenance theory suggests that we are motivated to maintain a positive self-image, which can be threatened by comparison to others.
4. Therefore, walking when identity is not provided may be a way to avoid the potential threat to one's self-image.

Answer: A desire to avoid social interaction.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If social identity is important to human behavior, then not having one may lead to discomfort or uncertainty in social situations. Additionally, the social context in which the person is walking may also play a role in their behavior.

Answer: Uncertainty or discomfort in social situations.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Identity salience theory suggests that people are more likely to conform to social norms when their identity is salient. If someone is walking in a context where their identity is not provided, they may feel less pressure to conform to social norms and may therefore behave differently.

Answer: Identity salience.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, the concept of social identity suggests that we define ourselves in part by the groups to which we belong. Second, self-evaluation maintenance theory suggests that we may feel threatened by others' success in areas that are important to our self-concept. Third, walking when one's identity is not provided may be a way to avoid feeling threatened by others' success.

Answer: To avoid feeling threatened.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If someone walks when their identity is not provided, it may be because they feel like they don't belong or they don't want to be judged based on their appearance. This relates to social identity and self-evaluation maintenance theory.

Answer: Feeling like they don't belong or not wanting to be judged based on appearance.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
There are various reasons why someone may walk when their identity is not provided in social situations. One possible explanation is provided by the concept of social identity and self-evaluation maintenance theory, which helps to explain how people react to threats to their self-esteem or social identity.

Answer: Various psychological factors, such as threats to one's self-esteem or social identity, may influence someone to walk when their identity is not provided in social situations.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If social identity is important to human behavior, then not having an identity might result in discomfort or uncertainty. If the social context also influences behavior, then the presence or absence of others might have an effect. Therefore, someone might walk when their identity is not provided due to discomfort or uncertainty in the absence of a social context.

Answer: Discomfort or uncertainty.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------

Question: What completed the triad

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context mentions multiple references to the "triad," including a nuclear triad and a musical triad. However, in context [2], the phrase "completing the triad" suggests that this is referring to a specific triad that has been previously mentioned or implied. In context [2], the triad is being described as "homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals." Therefore, the answer to the question "What completed the triad?" is "homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals."
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking what completed the triad. We see from the sources that the term "triad" is used in various contexts, including military force structure and music theory. However, source [4] specifically mentions "America's Nuclear Triad," which consists of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers. Therefore, the answer must be something related to these three components.

Answer: The triad was completed by heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear-armed cruise missiles and gravity bombs.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context mentions different things related to a "triad," such as a military force structure, carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes, and chords. However, based on the use of the term "completed," it is likely referring to a specific triad that was made whole. The context also mentions the "nuclear triad" in multiple sources, which refers to the three-pronged military force structure consisting of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear-missile-armed submarines, and strategic bombers. Therefore, the answer is likely related to the nuclear triad.

Answer: The nuclear triad was completed.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The term "triad" is mentioned in various contexts, including military forces, chemistry, and music theory. However, the question specifically mentions something that completed the triad. Based on the sources provided, the most likely answer refers to the nuclear triad, which is a three-pronged military force structure consisting of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear-missile-armed submarines, and strategic bombers.

Answer: The nuclear triad.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context provides multiple references to the term "triad" in different contexts, such as military force structure, chemical complexes, and music theory. However, the question specifically asks about what completed the triad, implying a specific context. Looking closer at the sources, we can see that source [2] mentions "completing the triad" in the title, and the abstract mentions the synthesis and characterization of certain metal complexes. Therefore, it is likely that the question is asking about the completion of a chemical triad, which is addressed in source [2].

Answer: Homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking for what completed the "triad." Based on the context, it seems that there are multiple possible interpretations for what "triad" is referring to. However, from the sources provided, it appears that the most likely interpretation is that the "triad" is referring to the "nuclear triad" - a three-pronged military force structure consisting of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear-missile-armed submarines, and strategic bombers. Therefore, the answer to the question "What completed the triad?" would be the addition of strategic bombers equipped to carry nuclear-armed cruise missiles and gravity bombs.

Answer: Strategic bombers equipped to carry nuclear-armed cruise missiles and gravity bombs.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question refers to completing the triad, which can refer to different contexts such as military force or chemical compounds. However, looking at the sources, we can see that most of them refer to the nuclear triad, which is a three-pronged military force structure consisting of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear-missile-armed submarines, and strategic bombers. Therefore, the answer is likely related to the nuclear triad.

Answer: The nuclear triad is completed by long-range land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and long-range heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear-armed cruise missiles and gravity bombs.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question refers to something completing the triad, so we need to identify what triad is being referred to. Sources [1], [4], [5], and [6] mention a "nuclear triad" which consists of land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and strategic bombers. Source [2] mentions a "triad" in reference to a specific type of chemical compound. Source [3] discusses musical triads, which are chords made up of three notes. Therefore, the most likely triad being referred to in the question is the nuclear triad mentioned in sources [1], [4], [5], and [6]. Now we need to identify what completed the nuclear triad.

Answer: The nuclear triad was completed by the addition of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question refers to completing the triad, which may have different contexts depending on the source. However, looking at the sources provided, sources [1], [4], [5], and [6] all refer to the "nuclear triad" in the context of military force structure, while source [3] refers to a "triad" as a three-note chord. Only source [2] mentions "completing the triad" in a different context, specifically in the synthesis and characterization of carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes. Therefore, the most likely answer is that carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes completed the triad, based on source [2].

Answer: carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Completing the triad can refer to different contexts, so let's look at the sources provided. Sources [1], [4], [5], and [6] all mention the "nuclear triad" in the context of military force structure, while source [2] mentions "homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals." Source [3] mentions triads in the context of music theory. Therefore, the correct response may be related to the military context mentioned in sources [1], [4], [5], and [6].

Answer: Nuclear missiles, armed submarines, and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear-armed cruise missiles and gravity bombs are the three components that make up the nuclear triad.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking for what completed the triad. The context contains several sources that mention a triad, but only one source mentions completing it. Looking at the sources, we can see that [2] mentions "completing the triad" in the title and discusses the synthesis of carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of group VI metals. Therefore, the answer must be related to the synthesis of these complexes.

Answer: Synthesis of carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of group VI metals.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Based on the context, there are multiple possible interpretations of "the triad." However, the second source specifically mentions "Completing the triad," and the title of the third source is "Triads." Therefore, it is likely that the question is referring to musical triads. 

Answer: Homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals (from source 2). Note: this answer is only applicable if the question is referring to the specific context of source 2.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context mentions several different references to a "triad," but only one of them talks about something being "completed." This is likely referring to [2], which mentions "completing the triad" in the title. Additionally, the context mentions that the "triad" refers to a military force structure consisting of three components. Therefore, the answer is likely something that completes this structure.

Answer: "homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals"
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context mentions multiple references to a "triad." We need to identify which specific triad is being referred to and what completed it.

Answer: homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question asks about what completed the triad. The context provides several sources that mention a nuclear triad, a group of three military forces consisting of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear-missile-armed submarines, and strategic bombers. One source specifically mentions "Completing the triad" in its title and talks about synthesizing and characterizing carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of group VI metals. Therefore, the answer is likely referring to the synthesis and characterization of these complexes.

Answer: Synthesis and characterization of homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The term "triad" can refer to different things, such as a military force structure, a type of chord, or a specific group of nuclear weapons. In this case, the question mentions "completing the triad," which suggests that we are talking about a specific set of three things. The sources mention different types of triads, but only one of them talks about something being completed. In source [2], the title mentions "Completing the triad," and the abstract mentions "homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals." Therefore, the answer must be something related to these metal complexes.

Answer: homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The term "triad" has multiple meanings, including a three-pronged military force structure, a type of chord in music, and a group of chemical compounds. Given the context provided, the question likely pertains to the nuclear triad, which refers to the three components of a country's nuclear arsenal. The sources mention the nuclear triad in the context of military strategy, metal complexes, music theory, and national security. The phrase "completed the triad" suggests that something was added to the triad to make it whole. Based on the sources provided, the answer is likely referring to a specific addition to the US nuclear triad.

Answer: The question is unclear as to which triad is being referred to, so there is no definitive answer. However, if the question pertains to the US nuclear triad, the answer could be "nuclear-armed cruise missiles and gravity bombs" (source 5 and 6).
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question refers to something that completed a "triad." Triad can refer to a military force structure or a three-note chord. The context includes references to a nuclear triad, homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes, and triads in music theory. However, the context also includes references to "completing the triad," which is likely referring to the synthesis and full characterization of something. Based on the sources provided, it is most likely referring to the synthesis and full characterization of homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals.

Answer: Homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context provides several references to the "nuclear triad" in different contexts, including military force structure, chemical complexes, and music theory. However, the question specifically asks what completed the triad, which suggests a focus on the military context. Looking at the sources, options [1], [4], [5], and [6] all mention the U.S. nuclear triad as a key aspect of national security. Option [2] is not relevant to the question. Option [3] refers to a different kind of triad (a three-note chord in music theory) and is not relevant to the question. Therefore, the most relevant sources to answer the question are [1], [4], [5], and [6].

Answer: The sources do not provide a clear answer to what completed the triad, as the triad is already considered a complete force structure consisting of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear missile-armed submarines, and strategic bombers equipped to carry nuclear weapons. Therefore, the question is not well-formed or answerable.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The context contains several references to the term "triad," which can refer to different things depending on the context. However, we can see from context [2] that the term is being used in chemistry, referring to the synthesis of certain complexes. Therefore, the question is likely asking what completed this synthesis process.

Answer: Homoleptic and heteroleptic carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes of the group VI metals.

1. Temur is mentioned in the sources.
2. The sources also mention someone named Timur.
3. Timur is described as a Turco-Mongol conqueror.
4. Temur is described as a grandson of the Mongol founder Kublai Khan.
5. Therefore, Temur was likely a ruler or leader of some kind, possibly within the Mongol Empire.

Answer: Temur was a grandson of the Mongol founder Kublai Khan and likely a ruler or leader within the Mongol Empire.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

Answer: It's unclear which Temur is being referred to as there are two individuals with similar names mentioned in the sources: Timur and Temür Khan.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Temur could refer to either Timur or Temür Khan. We can eliminate Timur as an option since he is already mentioned separately in the context. Therefore, Temur is likely referring to Temür Khan.

Answer: Temür Khan
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------

----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Temur could refer to Timur or to Temür Khan. We can rule out Timur as the answer because the question specifically asks for Temur. Therefore, we can conclude that Temur refers to Temür Khan.

Answer: Temür Khan
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Temur could refer to either Timur or Temür Khan. Which one is being referred to in this context?

Answer: Temür Khan was a grandson of Kublai Khan and achieved nominal suzerainty of all Mongol tribes during his rule.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

...................................assistant...................................
Temur could refer to either Timur or Temür Khan. We need to determine which one is being referred to based on the context provided.

Answer: It depends on the context. If the context is referring to a Turco-Mongol conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire, then Temur refers to Timur.

----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Temur is a name that could refer to multiple historical figures. Let's narrow it down by looking at the provided sources. [1] mentions a Timur or Tamerlane who was a conqueror and founded an empire in Afghanistan and [2] mentions a Temür Khan who was a grandson of Kublai Khan and achieved suzerainty over the Mongol people. Based on the context, it is most likely that the question is about Temür Khan since he is specifically referred to by name and is a Mongol ruler.

Answer: Temür Khan was a Mongol ruler and grandson of Kublai Khan.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------

...................................assistant...................................
Temur is a name that could refer to different historical figures. The sources provided mention two possibilities: Timur and Temür Khan. We need to determine which one is being referred to in this case.

Answer: Temur could refer to either Timur or Temür Khan, depending on the context.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Temur is a historical figure, so we need to look for historical sources. He is also referred to as Temür, so we need to make sure we are searching for both spellings. From the given sources, we can see that Temur was a Turco-Mongol conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire, but this description does not match the information given in the second source about Temür Khan. Therefore, we need to rely on the information from the second source to answer the question.

Answer: Temür was a son of the Crown Prince Zhenjin and a grandson of the Yuan founder Kublai Khan.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Temur is mentioned in the sources as a possible name, but it's unclear if it refers to Timur or Temür Khan. Let's look at the details provided in the sources to determine which one it is.

Answer: There are two possible Temurs mentioned in the sources: Timur (also known as Tamerlane) and Temür Khan.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 17 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
1. Temur is mentioned in the context.
2. The context mentions two different people with similar names: Timur and Temür Khan.
3. The description in the second source matches the name "Temur" more closely, as it mentions he was a grandson of Kublai Khan and achieved nominal suzerainty of all Mongol.

Answer: It is unclear which Temur is being referred to without further context.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Temur is mentioned in the sources as either Timur or Temür. [1][2] The sources provide some basic information about Timur, including his birth and death dates and the empire he founded. [1] The sources also mention Temür, who was a grandson of Kublai Khan and achieved nominal suzerainty over all Mongol tribes during his rule. [2] However, the question specifically asks about Temur, not Timur or Temür. It's possible that Temur is another name for Timur or Temür, but without further information it's unclear.

Answer: Unclear.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
- Temur is mentioned in the context.
- Context [2] provides more information about Temur.
- From context [2], Temur was a grandson of Kublai Khan and achieved nominal suzerainty of all Mongol lands.

Answer: Temur was a grandson of Kublai Khan and achieved nominal suzerainty of all Mongol lands.
