"Is the query ""Can chicken jump on Mars"" accurately addressed by the response (which has been split into a list of text segments) ""1. No, chicken cannot jump on Mars because Mars' gravity is only about 38% of Earth's gravity. 2. That means objects and creatures on Mars would weigh much less than they do on Earth, and that would make it difficult for a chicken or any other creature to jump. 3. Additionally, there is no evidence that chickens have ever been on Mars or that they could survive in the harsh, inhospitable conditions of the planet's atmosphere. 4. Therefore, it is safe to say that chickens cannot jump on Mars or live there."" ? List the IDs of the segments with errors (separated by commas).
