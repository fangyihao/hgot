...................................assistant...................................
[1] The context mentions that if a store does not have a posted return policy, they must accept returns within 20 days.
[2] Another source states that if a store does not post a return policy, they must accept returns within 30 days.
[3] The question asks if the return authorization form allows returns within 30 days.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] The source states that if a retailer does not have a posted return policy, they must allow returns within 20 days.
[2] Another source states that if a store does not post a return policy, they are legally required to accept returns within 30 days.

Based on these sources, if the return authorization form does not specify a different timeframe, it is likely that returns are allowed within 30 days.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] The first source states that if a retailer does not have a posted return policy, they must allow returns within 20 days.
[2] The second source states that if a store does not post a return policy, they must accept returns within 30 days.

Based on this information, we can deduce that the return authorization form likely allows returns within 30 days.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] and [2] state that if a store does not post a return policy, the law requires the store to accept returns within 30 days. Therefore, if the return authorization form allows returns, it should align with this legal requirement.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------

[1] If a store does not have a posted return policy, they are legally required to accept returns within 30 days. 
[2] The return authorization form is a process for customers to request a return. 

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] According to the Return and Refund Laws in the U.S., if a retailer does not have a posted return policy, they must accept returns within 20 days. 
[2] However, the Customer Returns and Refund Laws by State state that if a store does not post any return policy, they are required to accept returns within 30 days. 

Answer: Yes

[1] The first source states that if a retailer does not have a posted return policy, they must allow returns within 20 days.
[2] The second source states that if a store does not post a return policy, they must accept returns within 30 days.

Based on these sources, we can conclude that the return authorization form allows returns within 30 days.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] and [2] both state that if a store does not have a posted return policy, they are required by law to accept returns within 30 days. Therefore, it can be inferred that the return authorization form does allow returns within 30 days.

Answer: Yes

[1] The first source states that if a retailer does not have a posted return policy, they must allow returns within 20 days.

Based on these sources, we can conclude that the return authorization form likely allows returns within 30 days.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] and [2] state that if a store does not post a return policy, the law requires them to accept returns within 30 days. Therefore, if the return authorization form does not specify a different timeframe, it can be assumed that returns are allowed within 30 days.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] The response states that "If you’re having second thoughts about your purchase, and it was made within 30 days, you can return it!" This suggests that returns are allowed within 30 days.
[2] The sources mention that if a store does not post a return policy, the law requires them to accept returns within 30 days. This supports the idea that returns are permitted within 30 days.

Answer: Yes
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------

[1] The first source states that if a retailer does not have a posted return policy, they must allow returns within 20 days.
[2] The second source states that if a store does not post a return policy, they must accept returns within 30 days.

Since the question is asking specifically about the return authorization form, and not whether a return can be made without a posted return policy, neither of the sources provide a direct answer to the question. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the return authorization form allows returns within 30 days based on the provided information.
