However, we are looking for a single actor, so we need to narrow down the options.
From [1], we see that the list includes actors from various sources, including movies and TV shows.
Since Tales from the Crypt is a TV show, we can eliminate the actors who appeared in movies like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Hanks.
The remaining options are Brad Pitt, Michael J. Fox, Sandra Bullock, Demi Moore, Benicio Del Toro, Joan Collins, and Tom Baker.
From [2], we see that Tom Baker appeared in Vault of Horror, not Tales from the Crypt.
