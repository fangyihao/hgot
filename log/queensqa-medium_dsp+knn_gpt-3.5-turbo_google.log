...................................assistant...................................
[1] and [3] mention that Lululemon mats are not safe for people with latex allergies. [4] contradicts this by stating that Lululemon has latex-free mats. To verify which information is accurate, we can refer to [2], [5], and [6] for information about Lululemon mats. However, these sources do not provide specific information about whether the mats are latex-free or not. Therefore, we need to rely on the product information provided on the Lululemon website to determine if their mats are latex-free.

Answer: No
