Dafne was first performed during Carnival of 1598 (1597 old style) at the Palazzo Corsi.[4]. Dafne is scored for a much smaller ensemble than Claudio Monteverdi's slightly later operas, namely, a harpsichord, a lute, a viol, an archlute, and a triple flute.[5][further explanation needed] Drawing on a new development at the time, Peri established recitatives, melodic speech set to music, as a central part of opera.[6]. The story of Apollo falling in love with the eponymous nymph, Daphne, the opera was written for an elite circle of humanists in Florence, the Florentine Camerata, between 1594 and 1597, with the support, and possibly the collaboration, of the composer and patron Jacopo Corsi.[6][7] An attempt to revive Greek drama,[5] according to modern scholarship, it was a long way off from what the ancient Greeks would have recognized.[6]. Most of Peri's music has been lost, despite its popularity and fame in Europe at the time of its composition, but the 455-line verse libretto was published and survives.

Observation 3: Basidiomycota (/bəˌsɪdi.oʊmaɪˈkoʊtə/)[2] is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the "higher fungi") within the kingdom Fungi. Members are known as basidiomycetes.[3] More specifically, Basidiomycota includes these groups: agarics, puffballs, stinkhorns, bracket fungi, other polypores, jelly fungi, boletes, chanterelles, earth stars, smuts, bunts, rusts, mirror yeasts, and Cryptococcus, the human pathogenic yeast.. Basidiomycota are filamentous fungi composed of hyphae (except for basidiomycota-yeast) and reproduce sexually via the formation of specialized club-shaped end cells called basidia that normally bear external meiospores (usually four). These specialized spores are called basidiospores.[4] However, some Basidiomycota are obligate asexual reproducers. Basidiomycota that reproduce asexually (discussed below) can typically be recognized as members of this division by gross similarity to others, by the formation of a distinctive anatomical feature (the clamp connection), cell wall components, and definitively by phylogenetic molecular analysis of DNA sequence data..

Plants are dioecious, with separate male and female plants; female flowers are characterized by their four-lobed stigmas.[2] The species are found in subtropical and tropical regions of Asia, Malaysia, and Australia, where they grow in primary rainforest, gallery forest and monsoon forest and moister woodland. Species of this genus are notable as being the sole hosts of parasitic plants in the family Rafflesiaceae, one of which, Rafflesia arnoldii, produces the largest single flower in the world.[3] Tetrastigma is the donor species for horizontal gene transfer to Sapria and Rafflesia due to multiple gene theft events.[4]. Within the Vitaceae, Tetrastigma has long been considered closely related to Cayratia and Cyphostemma[5] and is now placed in the tribe Cayratieae..

Picea is the sole genus in the subfamily Piceoideae. Spruces are large trees, from about 20 to 60 m (about 60–200 ft) tall when mature, and have whorled branches and conical form. They can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by their needles (leaves), which are four-sided and attached singly to small persistent peg-like structures (pulvini or sterigmata[2]) on the branches, and by their cones (without any protruding bracts), which hang downwards after they are pollinated.[3] The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs.

In contrast, analogue portable audio players play music from non-digital media that use analogue media, such as cassette tapes or vinyl records.. Digital audio players (DAP) were often marketed as MP3 players even if they also supported other file formats and media types.[3][4] The PMP term was introduced later for devices that had additional capabilities such as video playback. Generally speaking, they are portable, employing internal or replaceable batteries, equipped with a 3.5 mm headphone jack which can be used for headphones or to connect to a boombox, shelf stereo system, or connect to car audio and home stereos wired or via a wireless connection such as Bluetooth. Some players also include radio tuners, voice recording and other features..

Thought 1: I need to search portable media player and HP, and find the portable media player that was distributed through HP.
Action 1: Search[portable media player]
Observation 1: A portable media player (PMP) or digital audio player (DAP) is a portable consumer electronics device capable of storing and playing digital media such as audio, images, and video files.[1][2] The data is typically stored on a compact disc (CD), Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), Blu-ray Disc (BD), flash memory, microdrive, SD cards or hard drive; most earlier PMPs used physical media, but modern players mostly use flash memory. In contrast, analogue portable audio players play music from non-digital media that use analogue media, such as cassette tapes or vinyl records.. Digital audio players (DAP) were often marketed as MP3 players even if they also supported other file formats and media types.[3][4] The PMP term was introduced later for devices that had additional capabilities such as video playback. Generally speaking, they are portable, employing internal or replaceable batteries, equipped with a 3.5 mm headphone jack which can be used for headphones or to connect to a boombox, shelf stereo system, or connect to car audio and home stereos wired or via a wireless connection such as Bluetooth. Some players also include radio tuners, voice recording and other features..
Thought 2: I need to look up HP.
Action 2: Lookup[HP]
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) It could store up to an hour of music, but despite getting an award at CES 1997 only 25 of the devices were made.[22][23] That same year AT&T developed the FlashPAC digital audio player which initially used AT&T's Perceptual Audio Coder (PAC)[24] for music compression, but in 1997 switched to AAC.[25] At about the same time AT&T also developed an internal Web-based music streaming service that had the ability to download music to FlashPAC.[26] AAC and such music downloading services later formed the foundation for the Apple iPod and iTunes.[27].

Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming a group "Teenagers" with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which after several name changes, would become the Wailers.

While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari.

They are native to the Americas and the Caribbean in a wide range of habitats, from humid rainforest and wet subtropical ecosystems to the hot and dry (arid) deserts and savanna.. Early reports of the species were confused with the cassava (Manihot esculenta).[3] Consequently, Linnaeus mistakenly derived the generic name from the Taíno word for the latter, yuca.[4] The Aztecs living in Mexico since before the Spanish arrival, in Nahuatl, call the local yucca species (Yucca gigantea) iczotl, which gave the Spanish izote.[5][6] Izote is also used for Yucca filifera.[7]. The natural distribution range of the genus Yucca (49 species and 24 subspecies) covers a vast area of the Americas. The genus is represented throughout Mexico and extends into Guatemala (Yucca guatemalensis).

They are native to the Americas and the Caribbean in a wide range of habitats, from humid rainforest and wet subtropical ecosystems to the hot and dry (arid) deserts and savanna.. Early reports of the species were confused with the cassava (Manihot esculenta).[3] Consequently, Linnaeus mistakenly derived the generic name from the Taíno word for the latter, yuca.[4] The Aztecs living in Mexico since before the Spanish arrival, in Nahuatl, call the local yucca species (Yucca gigantea) iczotl, which gave the Spanish izote.[5][6] Izote is also used for Yucca filifera.[7]. The natural distribution range of the genus Yucca (49 species and 24 subspecies) covers a vast area of the Americas. The genus is represented throughout Mexico and extends into Guatemala (Yucca guatemalensis).

Arbutus are small trees or shrubs with red flaking bark and edible red berries.[6] Fruit development is delayed for about five months after pollination, so that flowers appear while the previous year's fruit are ripening.[6] Peak flowering for the genus is in April with peak fruiting in October.[7]. The smooth wood of the tree is mentioned by Theophrastus in his Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) as formerly being used to make weaving spindles. An article on Arbutus tree cultivation in al-Andalus (in Arabic: قُطلُب, romanized: quṭlub) is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.[8]. Members of the genus are called madrones or madronas in the United States, from the Spanish name madroño (strawberry tree).

Thought 1: I need to search Arbutus and Aspidistra, and find their types of plants.
Action 1: Search[Arbutus]
Observation 1: Arbutus is a genus of 12 accepted species[2] of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae,[3] native to warm temperate regions of the Mediterranean, western Europe, the Canary Islands and North America known as madrones.[4] The name Arbutus was taken from Latin, where it referred to Arbutus unedo.[5]. Arbutus are small trees or shrubs with red flaking bark and edible red berries.[6] Fruit development is delayed for about five months after pollination, so that flowers appear while the previous year's fruit are ripening.[6] Peak flowering for the genus is in April with peak fruiting in October.[7]. The smooth wood of the tree is mentioned by Theophrastus in his Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) as formerly being used to make weaving spindles. An article on Arbutus tree cultivation in al-Andalus (in Arabic: قُطلُب, romanized: quṭlub) is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.[8]. Members of the genus are called madrones or madronas in the United States, from the Spanish name madroño (strawberry tree).
Thought 2: Arbutus is a genus of flowering plants. I need to search Aspidistra next and find its type of plant.
Action 2: Search[Aspidistra]
Observation 2: Aspidistra /ˌæspɪˈdɪstrə/[2] is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae, native to eastern and southeastern Asia, particularly China and Vietnam.[1][3] They grow in shade under trees and shrubs. Their leaves arise more or less directly from ground level, where their flowers also appear. The number of species known has increased considerably from the 1980s onwards, with around 100 accepted as of July 2013[update]. Aspidistra elatior is common worldwide as a foliage house plant that is very tolerant of neglect. It and other species can also be grown in shade outside, where they are generally hardy to −5 °C (23 °F)..

Observation 2: Ibn Taymiyya (January 22, 1263 – September 26, 1328; Arabic: ابن تيمية), birth name Taqī ad-Dīn ʾAḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm ibn ʿAbd al-Salām al-Numayrī al-Ḥarrānī (Arabic: تقي الدين أحمد بن عبد الحليم بن عبد السلام النميري الحراني)[11] was a Sunni Muslim ʿālim,[12][13][14] muhaddith, judge,[15][16] proto-Salafist theologian,[a] ascetic, and iconoclastic theologian.[17][14] He is known for his diplomatic involvement with the Ilkhanid ruler Ghazan Khan and for his involvement at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar which ended the Mongol invasions of the Levant.[18] A legal jurist of the Hanbali school, Ibn Taymiyya's condemnation of numerous folk practices associated with saint veneration and visitation of tombs made him a contentious figure with rulers and scholars of the time, and he was imprisoned several times as a result.[19]. A polarizing figure in his own times and in the centuries that followed,[20][21] Ibn Taymiyya has emerged as one of the most influential medieval scholars in late modern Sunni Islam.[19] He was also noteworthy for engaging in fierce religious polemics that attacked various schools of Kalām (speculative theology); primarily Ash'arism and Maturidism, while defending the doctrines of Athari school. This prompted rival clerics and state authorities to accuse Ibn Taymiyya and his disciples of tashbīh (anthropomorphism); which eventually led to the censoring of his works and subsequent incarceration.[22][23][24]. Nevertheless, Ibn Taymiyya's numerous treatises that advocates for "creedal Salafism" (al-salafiyya al-iʿtiqādīyya), based on his scholarly interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, constitute the most popular classical reference for later Salafi movements.[25] Ibn Taymiyya asserted through his treatises that there is no contradiction between reason and revelation,[26] and denounced the usage of philosophy as a pre-requisite in seeking religious truth.[27] As a cleric who viewed Shi'ism as a source of corruption in Muslim societies; Ibn Taymiyya was also known for virulent anti-Shia polemics through treatises like Minhaj al-Sunna, wherein he denounced Imami Shi'ite creed as heretical. Ibn Taymiyya declared a fatwa to wage Jihad against the Shi'ites of Kisrawan and personally fought in the Kisrawan campaigns, accusing Shi'ites of acting as the fifth-columinists of Frank Crusaders and Mongol Ilkhanates.[28].

She also deplored food additives. Although the Ann Wigmore Foundation received accreditation as a non-profit, many of her claims were denounced as quackery, and her qualifications were never confirmed to be genuine.. Wigmore was inspired in part by the ideas of Maximilian Bircher-Benner (1867–1939), who was influenced as a young man by the German Lebensreform movement, which saw civilization as corrupt and which sought to go "back to nature"; it embraced holistic medicine, nudism, various forms of spirituality, free love, exercise and other outdoors activity, and foods that it judged were more "natural".[1]: 31–33  Bircher-Benner eventually adopted a vegetarian diet, but took that further and decided that raw food was what humans were really meant to eat.

The skull forms the anterior-most portion of the skeleton and is a product of cephalisation—housing the brain, and several sensory structures such as the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.[3] In humans, these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton.. Functions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision, and fixing the position of the ears to enable sound localisation of the direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, such as horned ungulates (mammals with hooves), the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the frontal bone) for the horns.. The English word skull is probably derived from Old Norse skulle,[4] while the Latin word cranium comes from the Greek root κρανίον (kranion).

Observation 1: The skull is a bone protective cavity for the brain.[1] The skull is composed of four types of bone i.e., cranial bones, facial bones, ear ossicles and hyoid bone, however two parts are more prominent: the cranium (pl.: craniums or crania) and the mandible.[2] In humans, these two parts are the neurocranium (braincase) and the viscerocranium (facial skeleton) that includes the mandible as its largest bone. The skull forms the anterior-most portion of the skeleton and is a product of cephalisation—housing the brain, and several sensory structures such as the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.[3] In humans, these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton.. Functions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision, and fixing the position of the ears to enable sound localisation of the direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, such as horned ungulates (mammals with hooves), the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the frontal bone) for the horns.. The English word skull is probably derived from Old Norse skulle,[4] while the Latin word cranium comes from the Greek root κρανίον (kranion).

Before people of European ancestry came to the area, the land was part of the territory of the Meroke Indians.[6][7] Written records of the community go back to the 1640s.[7] The village now known as Freeport was part of an area called "the Great South Woods" during colonial times.[7] In the mid-17th century, the area was renamed Raynor South, and ultimately Raynortown, after a herdsman named Edward Raynor, who had moved to the area from Hempstead in 1659, cleared land, and built a cabin.[5][7][8]. In 1853, residents voted to rename the village Freeport, adopting a variant of a nickname used by ship captains during colonial times because they were not charged customs duties to land their cargo.[5][7][8].

The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present.

As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium,[3] or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.. Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400[4] to over 640.[5][6][7]. Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.[8].

Question: Which has more species, Festuca or Dactylis?
Thought 1: I need to search Festuca and Dactylis, and find which has more species.
Action 1: Search[Festuca]
Observation 1: Festuca (fescue) is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10–200 cm (4–79 in) and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica.[2] The genus is closely related to ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the forage grasses tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium,[3] or alternatively into the segregate genus Schedonorus.. Because the taxonomy is complex, scientists have not determined how many true species belong to the genus, but estimates range from more than 400[4] to over 640.[5][6][7]. Fescue pollen is a significant contributor to hay fever.[8].
Thought 2: Festuca has over 400 species. I need to search Dactylis next and find how many species it has.
Action 2: Search[Dactylis]
Observation 2: Dactylis is a genus of Eurasian and North African plants in the bluegrass subfamily within the grass family.[3][4] Dactylis is native to North Africa, they are found throughout the world, and are  an invasive species.[5] They are known in English as cock's-foot or cocksfoot grasses, also sometimes as orchard grasses.. The genus has been treated as containing only a single species Dactylis glomerata by many authors, treating variation in the genus at only subspecific rank within D. glomerata,[6][7][8] but more recently, there has been a trend to accept two species,[9] while some authors accept even more species in the genus, particularly island endemic species in Macaronesia.[10][11][12][13]. Dactylis species are perennial grasses, forming dense tussocks growing to 15–140 centimetres tall, with leaves 20–50 cm long and up to 1.5 cm broad, and distinctive tufted triangular flowerheads comprising a panicle 10–15 cm long, turning pale grey-brown at seed maturity. The spikelets are 5–9 mm long, typically containing two to five flowers.
Thought 3:
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
 Dactylis has at least two species. 400 (Festuca) > 2 (Dactylis), so Festuca has more species.

Intended as the first installment in a multimedia franchise, the film combines various elements from the eight-novel series, mostly from the first and third volumes, and takes place in both modern-day New York City and in Mid-World, Roland's Old West-style parallel universe. The film also serves as a sequel to the novels.[6][7]. The production of the film was complex and difficult, as production began ten years before the release of the film.[8] Efforts to adapt The Dark Tower series for the screen started in 2007, with periodic reports and official announcements.

The adjective Ortonesque refers to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.[6].

A close friend and collaborator with the avant-garde director Patrice Chéreau, the two created groundbreaking work together at both the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in New York City and the Théâtre des Amandiers in Nanterre.. At the time of his death, Koltès was considered to be one of the most important young voices in French theatre, and heir apparent to the legacy left by post-war playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Jean Cocteau and Jean Genet. His plays have since become staples on the modern repertory around the world, having been translated into more than 36 languages..

Sacagawea traveled with the expedition thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean, helping to establish cultural contacts with Native American people and contributing to the expedition's knowledge of natural history in different regions.. The National American Woman Suffrage Association of the early 20th century adopted Sacagawea as a symbol of women's worth and independence, erecting several statues and plaques in her memory, and doing much to recount her accomplishments.[5]. Reliable historical information about Sacagawea is very limited. She was born c. 1788 into the Agaidika ('Salmon Eater', aka Lemhi Shoshone) tribe near present-day Salmon, Idaho.

Observation 3: The Lemhi Shoshone are a tribe of Northern Shoshone, also called the Akaitikka, Agaidika, or "Eaters of Salmon".[1] The name "Lemhi" comes from Fort Lemhi, a Mormon mission to this group. They traditionally lived in the Lemhi River Valley and along the upper Salmon River in Idaho.[1] Bands were very fluid and nomadic, and they often interacted with and intermarried other bands of Shoshone and other tribes, such as the Bannock.[2] Today most of them are enrolled in the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation of Idaho.. The Akaitikka are Numic speakers, speaking the Shoshone language.[3]. Fishing is an important source of food, and salmon, and trout were staples. Gooseberries and camas root, Camassia quamash are traditional vegetable foods for the Lemhi Shoshone.[4] In the 19th century, buffalo hunting provided meat, furs, hides, and other materials.[5].

FedEx today is best known for its air delivery service, FedEx Express, which was one of the first major shipping companies to offer overnight delivery as a flagship service. Since then, FedEx also started FedEx Ground, FedEx Office (originally known as Kinko's), FedEx Supply Chain, FedEx Freight, and various other services across multiple subsidiaries, often meant to respond to its main competitor, UPS. The company is the fifth largest American-headquartered employer globally with 547,000 employees, and FedEx is also one of the top contractors of the US government and assists in the transport of some United States Postal Service packages through their Air Cargo Network contract.[5].

Customers could order a wide range of products from VA's website, then VA would transmit the orders directly to the manufacturers, and the manufacturers would then package the products and ship them directly to the customer. Winn referred to this concept as "convergence commerce".[3] Value America was backed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures and FedEx co-founder Frederick W. Smith.[4]. Value America's initial public offering in April 1999 was a success: on the first day the stock closed at $55 a share, valuing the three-year-old profitless company at $2.4 Billion..

The show was created by Ant & Dec, who also host it. As implied by the title, PokerFace, is based on the bluffing aspect of poker games. The contestants do not necessarily need to get the questions right in order to win, and can bluff their way through the game and pressure their opponents into folding in order to win.[1][2]. The show was originally going to be called The Con Test,[3] but the name was changed just weeks before the show began.[4] However, the Australian version is called The Con Test.

Thought 3: Ant & Dec are from the order Hymenoptera. I need to find where the order Hymenoptera is from.
Action 3: Search[Hymenoptera]
Observation 3: Hymenoptera is a large order of insects, comprising the sawflies, wasps, bees, and ants. Over 150,000 living species of Hymenoptera have been described,[2][3] in addition to over 2,000 extinct ones.[4] Many of the species are parasitic.. Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or places that are otherwise inaccessible. This ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)—that is, they have a wormlike larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature..
Thought 4: Hymenoptera is from the order Lepidoptera. I need to find where the order Lepidoptera is from.
Action 4: Search[Lepidoptera]
Observation 4: Lepidoptera (/ˌlɛpɪˈdɒptərə/ LEP-ih-DOP-tər-ə) is an order of insects that includes butterflies and moths (both are called lepidopterans). About 180,000 species of the Lepidoptera have been described, representing ten percent of the total described species of living organisms,[1][2] and placed in 126 families[3] and 46 superfamilies.[1]  It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world.[4] The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought,[5] and is among the four most species-rich orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.[4]. Lepidopteran species are characterized by more than three derived features. The most apparent is the presence of scales that cover the bodies, wings, and a proboscis.
Thought 5: Lepidoptera is from the order Diptera. I need to find where the order Diptera is from.
Action 5: Search[Diptera]
Observation 5: Housefly (Muscidae) (top left). Haematopota pluvialis (Tabanidae) (top right). Ctenophora pectinicornis (Tipulidae) (mid left). Ochlerotatus notoscriptus (Culicidae) (mid right). Milesia crabroniformis (Syrphidae) (bottom left).
Thought 6: Diptera is from the order Muscidae. I need to find where the order Muscidae is from.
Action 6: Search[Muscidae]
Observation 6: Muscidae are a family of flies found in the superfamily Muscoidea.. Muscidae, some of which are commonly known as house flies or stable flies due to their synanthropy, are worldwide in distribution and contain almost 4,000 described species in over 100 genera.. Most species are not synanthropic. Adults can be predatory, hematophagous, saprophagous, or feed on a number of types of plant and animal exudates. They can be attracted to various substances including sugar, sweat, tears [1] and blood.
