The song "Always and Forever" was written by Rod Temperton and produced by Barry Blue. It was first recorded by the British-based multinational funk-disco band Heatwave in 1976. However, the question asks about a singer-songwriter who achieved his 3rd No 1 single by writing "Always and Forever." This suggests that the singer-songwriter in question is different from Rod Temperton, who wrote the song. To find the answer, we need to search for a singer-songwriter who achieved his 3rd No 1 single by writing "Always and Forever."
