1. ESZ stands for Edition Schott, a German music publisher.
2. The question is asking for composers represented by ESZ since the 1950s, so we need to look for a list of 20th-century classical composers.
3. Sources [3] and [4] both provide lists of 20th-century classical composers, so we can check those.
4. We are given some composers in the question stem, so we need to find others besides those.
5. The answer will be a list of composers represented by ESZ since the 1950s.

The question is asking for the genus of a viral disease with specific symptoms. The question mentions fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains, and headaches, which are symptoms of multiple viral diseases. However, the question also mentions a chance of liver damage, which narrows down the possibilities. One viral disease that fits this description is yellow fever, which is caused by the Flavivirus genus.
