The question is asking about the main industry of a town that has a population of around 2,600 as of 2010 and is home to Mountain Valley High School. The context does not provide a town with that specific population. However, it mentions Rumford, which is home to Mountain Valley High School. The population of Rumford is given as 5,858 in 2020, which is significantly higher than the 2,600 mentioned in the question. Despite the discrepancy in population, if we assume that the question is referring to Rumford, the main industry in this town is mentioned in the context as being dominated by a paper mill, specifically ND Paper Inc's Rumford Mill.

First, we need to identify who George Albert Smith and Wong Jing are. George Albert Smith was the 8th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a significant role in the church. Wong Jing, on the other hand, is a Hong Kong film director and producer, with no known significant roles in any church. Therefore, based on their known roles, George Albert Smith played a more important role in the church.

First, we need to understand the professions of both Pete Dexter and Elie Wiesel. Pete Dexter is an American novelist. On the other hand, Elie Wiesel was a Romanian-born American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel laureate, and Holocaust survivor. Comparing the two, it is clear that Elie Wiesel had a wider scope of profession as he was involved in various fields such as writing, teaching, activism, and he was also a Nobel laureate.

From the first source, we know that Wim Jonk co-manages Cruyff Football with Jordi Cruyff. The fourth source mentions that Jordi Cruyff is stepping down as Barcelona's sporting director, but it doesn't specify which team he is currently managing. Therefore, we need to look at the other sources for this information. The third source tells us about Jordi Cruyff's playing career, but not his current managerial role. The second source, however, tells us that Wim Jonk is the current technical manager of FC Volendam, but it doesn't mention Jordi Cruyff's current team.

First, we know from the context that Serena Williams has won a record 13 Grand Slam singles titles. This is a significant achievement in the world of tennis. The context does not provide specific information about Mariaan de Swardt's achievements, but given that Serena Williams' record is highlighted, it is reasonable to infer that de Swardt has not achieved the same level of success. Therefore, we can conclude that Serena Williams is more accomplished than Mariaan de Swardt in her tennis career due to her record number of Grand Slam singles titles.

First, we need to identify the army that was defeated by the West Saxon forces. From source [1], we learn about a battle where Alfred led the West Saxons to victory. Source [2] also mentions Alfred leading the West Saxon forces. Therefore, we can deduce that the army defeated by the West Saxon forces was led by someone opposing Alfred. Source [3] and [4] mention Guthrum, a leader of a major Danish invasion of Anglo-Saxon England and one of the leaders of the "Great Summer Army". Therefore, we can deduce that Guthrum was the leader of the army defeated by the West Saxon forces. As for his rank, source [4] tells us that Guthrum was the King of East Anglia.

First, we need to identify the school where Aaron Parrett teaches. Both sources [1] and [2] mention that he is a Professor of English Literature at the University of Providence. Next, we need to determine whether the University of Providence is a public or private institution. Source [3] clearly states that "The University of Providence is a private, Roman Catholic liberal arts university". Therefore, the school where Aaron Parrett teaches is private.
