Answer: Inertia
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] Inertia causes a moving object to stay in motion at the same velocity unless a force acts on it to change its speed or direction.
[2] When forces are balanced, an object will either continue moving at a constant velocity if it was already in motion, or remain at rest.
[3] A body at rest tends to remain at rest and a body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.

...................................assistant...................................
When forces are balanced, an object will continue moving at a constant velocity if it was already in motion, or remain at rest. This is known as Newton's First Law of Motion or the Law of Inertia.

Answer: Newton's First Law of Motion or the Law of Inertia applies equally to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, Newton's First Law of Motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by an external force. This principle applies equally to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.

Answer: Newton's First Law of Motion
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If an object is in motion at a constant velocity, it will continue moving at that velocity unless acted on by an external force. Similarly, if an object is at rest, it will remain at rest unless acted on by an external force.

Answer: Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia) applies equally to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 15 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The concept of inertia applies equally to constant velocity motion as it does to rest because Newton's first law of motion states that an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity, and an object at rest will remain at rest, unless acted on by an external force.

Newton's second law states that acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

Answer: The object in the system.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, according to Newton's second law of motion, acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force applied to an object. Second, this acceleration occurs in the direction of the force and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

Answer: The object or system experiences acceleration.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, let's recall Newton's second law of motion, which states that acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force applied to an object or system. This means that when an external force is applied to a system, the system will experience acceleration.

Answer: the system
