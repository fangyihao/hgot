Christian perfection is a theological concept within some sects of Christianity. It is based on the idea that one can achieve spiritual perfection through the practice of charity or love, which unites the soul to God.

The demand for perfection is frequently repeated in the New Testament, with Jesus telling his disciples to be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect. Wesley's Doctrine of Christian Perfection emphasizes the triumph of God's grace over sin and the prospect of experiencing the full salvation that God promises.
