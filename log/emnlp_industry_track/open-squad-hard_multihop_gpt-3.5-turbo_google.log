Miami's Sun Life Stadium was a finalist to host Super Bowl 50, but it was no longer in the running. According to sources [1][3][4], the hosting city for the Super Bowl is chosen years in advance of the actual game. Therefore, something must have happened to cause Miami's stadium to be eliminated from consideration. Source [4] mentions that Miami's stadium issues clouded its bid to host the Super Bowl. Therefore, it can be inferred that the entity that caused Miami's Sun Life Stadium to no longer be in the running to host Super Bowl 50 was the stadium's issues.

The exiled Polish government established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in order to help Poles persecuted by the NKVD. However, the Soviet Union was in the process of incorporating lands in eastern Poland and expelling the Polish population. The Allied victory over Nazi Germany resulted in the Soviet Union gaining control over Poland. Therefore, the exiled Polish government likely did not trust the Soviet Union to protect Polish interests and wanted to establish control over Warsaw before the arrival of the Red Army.

Answer: The exiled Polish government ordered the underground Home Army to seize control of Warsaw prior to the arrival of the Red Army because they did not trust the Soviet Union to protect Polish interests.

If P = NP is unsolved, then it is not known whether NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time. If reduction is applied from a known NP-complete problem Π2 to Π1, and Π1 can be solved in polynomial time, then it would imply that all NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time, which would mean that P = NP.

- The question is asking about an algorithm related to finite polynomial hierarchy and graph isomorphism.
- Sources [1], [2], and [3] mention different algorithms for graph isomorphism, but do not specify which one is considered the most effective.
- Source [4] mentions the graph isomorphism problem and the search for an algorithm to solve it, but does not provide a clear answer to the question.
- Therefore, we need to look for additional sources or information to answer the question.

Kennedy delivered a speech at Rice University to inspire Americans to support NASA's mission to the moon. He discussed the necessity for the United States to become an international leader in space exploration. Kennedy promised to put an American astronaut on the moon before the end of the 1960s. Going to the moon was a bold idea and came to be known as the “Moon Shot.” Therefore, the term Kennedy used to show that America was falling behind the Soviet Union due to inactivity in space programs was "Moon Shot."

- The current rate of deforestation in the Amazon is causing significant loss of trees.
- If the current rate continues, it is estimated that 27% of the Amazon will be without trees by 2030.
- However, a new computer model suggests that as much as 55% of the Amazon will be either cleared or damaged by 2030.
- Therefore, if this computer model is correct, there would be a nearly complete loss of rainforest in the Amazon basin by 2030.

NASA and other sources have reported on the impact of drought on the Amazon rainforest. Some scientists have warned that the combination of climate change, deforestation, and fires could cause the forest to reach a "tipping point." Therefore, the organization that argued this point is likely a scientific or environmental group that has studied the Amazon.

Answer: It is not specified which organization made this argument, but multiple sources have reported on the possibility of the Amazon rainforest reaching a tipping point due to drought, deforestation, and other factors.

Step 1: The question asks for a leading English tapestry workshop.

Step 3: The question mentions the V&A collection, so the answer must be a workshop whose tapestries are represented in the V&A collection.
Step 4: According to sources [1] and [2], the Gobelins and Beauvais factories were state-run manufacturing concerns in the 17th century, but they were in France, not England. Therefore, the answer must be a different workshop.
Step 5: According to source [3], the only surviving tapestry with the workshop mark for Mazarind, together with the England mark (cross of St George), is in the V&A collection. Therefore, the answer is Mazarind.

- Euclid's theorem states that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
- Dirichlet's theorem extends this to primes in arithmetic progressions.
- Dirichlet's theorem requires that the two numbers in the arithmetic progression are coprime.
- Coprime means that the only positive integer that divides both numbers is 1.

The harmonic series of primes is the sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers. This series diverges, meaning that the sum increases without bound. This is because the primes are infinite in number. Therefore, the property of the harmonic series that shows there is an infinite number of primes is its divergence.

- The Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.
- The Riemann zeta function is denoted by ζ(x) and is defined as an infinite series.
- The Riemann hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeroes of the ζ-function have real part equal to 1/2.
- Therefore, the only exceptions to this rule would be the trivial zeroes, which occur at negative even integers.

Goldbach's conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in number theory. Lemoine's conjecture, also known as Levy's conjecture, is related to Goldbach's conjecture. The Goldbach conjecture for practical numbers was proven in 1996. Brocard's conjecture is a different unsolved problem in number theory. Therefore, the conjecture that holds that there are always a minimum of 4 primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2 must be a different one.

Step 1: Fermat's theorem states that if p is a prime other than 2 or 5, then 10^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p).
Step 2: This means that the decimal expansion of 1/p will have a repeating block of p-1 digits.
Step 3: Therefore, 1/p will always be a repeating decimal.

Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a^p - a is an integer multiple of p. This can be rewritten as a^p ≡ a (mod p). If we take a = 10 and p is a prime that is not 2 or 5, then we can see that 10^p ≡ 10 (mod p). This means that the period of the repeating decimal of 1/p is p-1 digits long.

1. We need to find a prime number p that satisfies the condition that p^2 divides 2^p-1 - 1. This is known as a Wieferich prime.
2. We then need to find a base q such that 1/p can be expressed in base q with a period of p-1.
3. Using the formula f = 1/P, we can find the frequency of the function, which will be equal to q^(p-1).
4. We need to find a value of q that satisfies the equation q^(p-1) = 1 mod p.

Answer: A prime number p must satisfy the condition that p^2 divides 2^p-1 - 1, and a base q must satisfy the equation q^(p-1) = 1 mod p in order for 1/p to be expressed in base q with a period of p-1.

These members were baptized as infants or children, but have not made a conscious profession of faith. They are not considered catechumens, as that term refers to adults who have never been baptized. They are also not candidates for believer's baptism, as they have already been baptized. Therefore, there is no special term for them.

If the net force on an object is zero, then the object is at equilibrium and not accelerating. In order for the net force to be zero, the forces acting on the object must be balanced, meaning they have equal magnitudes and opposite directions. Therefore, if you do not know both magnitude and direction of two forces on an object, it is impossible to determine if they are balanced or not.

Answer: It is impossible to determine if the forces are balanced or not.
