Chesapeake Bay is a large body of water, so we need to identify its location. The sources mention that it stretches from Cooperstown, New York, to Norfolk, Virginia, and includes parts of six states - Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia - and the entire District of Columbia. The sources also mention that the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin extends into six states - Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York, and the federal capital of Washington, D.C. Finally, the sources state that the Chesapeake Bay watershed encompasses parts of six states - Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Therefore, Chesapeake Bay is located on the east coast of the United States, spanning parts of six states and the District of Columbia.

From the context, we know that there are multiple people named Toshi, so we need to narrow it down to the ones that share creative pursuits with Emily Haines. We see that one Toshi is a musician, another is a librarian, and another is a character in a movie. Emily Haines is a singer and songwriter. Therefore, the Toshi who shares creative pursuits with Emily Haines is a musician.

Answer: Musician.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------

Both Toshi and Emily Haines are mentioned in the sources. We know that Emily Haines is a Canadian singer and songwriter who is part of the band Metric and has also had a successful solo career. One of the sources also mentions another person named Toshi who shares some creative pursuits with Emily Haines. We have to identify the occupations that Toshi and Emily Haines share.
