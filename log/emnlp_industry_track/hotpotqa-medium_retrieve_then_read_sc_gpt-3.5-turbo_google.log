Answer: King

...................................assistant...................................
The question asks about the rank of a leader defeated by West Saxon forces. The sources mention several battles involving West Saxons and other groups, including the Battle of Edington, where Alfred the Great defeated the Viking leader Guthrum. However, the question specifically asks about the defeated leader's rank. Source [5] states that loyalty to a chief was highly valued in Anglo-Saxon military organization, so it is likely that the defeated leader held a high rank. Source [2] mentions the Royal Saxon Army, which was the military force of the Electorate and later the Kingdom of Saxony. This provides a possible connection to the question, as Saxony is a Germanic region that was part of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included parts of England during the Anglo-Saxon period. However, the question specifically mentions a leader defeated by West Saxon forces, so this connection may not be relevant. Source [4] mentions a battle between King Ecgberht of the West Saxons and Beornwulf, king of the Mercians, but does not provide information about the defeated leader's rank. Therefore, the correct answer is not clear from the given sources.

Answer: Not enough information provided.

The question refers to a leader of an army defeated by West Saxon forces. The context mentions several battles involving West Saxons and other kingdoms or armies. We can narrow it down by focusing on the battles where the West Saxons were victorious. The context mentions the Battle of Edington, where the West Saxons defeated the Danish army, and the battle at Ellendun, where King Ecgberht defeated the Mercian king Beornwulf. Since the question does not specify which battle, we can assume it could refer to either. Therefore, the answer could be either Guthrum or Beornwulf, depending on which battle is being referred to.

Answer: Guthrum or Beornwulf
