J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders for the 2014 season. Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as the aging Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts»

"Slate" writer Justin Peters, after viewing every Super Bowl over a two-month period before Super Bowl 50, considered Minnesota the worst franchise in Super Bowl history.

Context:
[1] «Complexity class | can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication. This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem "X" is "hard" for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to "X". Thus no problem in C is»
[2] «Division algorithm | the initial Newton inversion only one (truncated) multiplication is needed for each division. The division by a constant "D" is equivalent to the multiplication by its reciprocal. Since the denominator is constant, so is its reciprocal (1/"D"). Thus it is possible to compute the value of (1/"D") once at compile time, and at run time perform the multiplication "N"·(1/"D") rather than the division "N/D". In floating-point arithmetic the use of (1/"D") presents little problem, but in integer arithmetic the reciprocal will always evaluate to zero (assuming |"D"| > 1). It is not necessary to use specifically (1/"D"); any value ("X"/"Y")»

If one uses the Euclidean algorithm and the elementary algorithms for multiplication and division, the computation of the greatest common divisor of two integers of at most bits is formula_19 This means that the computation of greatest common divisor has, up to a constant factor, the same complexity as the multiplication. However, if a fast multiplication algorithm is used, one may modify the Euclidean algorithm for improving the complexity, but the computation of a greatest common divisor becomes slower than the multiplication. More precisely, if the multiplication of two integers of bits takes a time of , then the»
[4] «Multiplication algorithm | two input numbers in base "D". If the result must be kept in memory then the space complexity is trivially Θ("n"). However, in certain applications, the entire result need not be kept in memory and instead the digits of the result can be streamed out as they are computed (for example, to system console or file). In these scenarios, long multiplication has the advantage that it can easily be formulated as a log space algorithm; that is, an algorithm that only needs working space proportional to the logarithm of the number of digits in the input (Θ(log "n")). This is»
[5] «Fixed-point arithmetic | loss is possible. For instance, the result of fixed point multiplication could potentially have as many bits as the sum of the number of bits in the two operands. In order to fit the result into the same number of bits as the operands, the answer must be rounded or truncated. If this is the case, the choice of which bits to keep is very important. When multiplying two fixed point numbers with the same format, for instance with formula_1 integer bits, and formula_2 fractional bits, the answer could have up to formula_3 integer bits, and formula_4 fractional bits.

One of the most fundamental EXPTIME-complete problems is a simpler version of this, which asks if a DTM halts in at most "k" steps. It is in EXPTIME because a trivial simulation requires O("k") time, and the input "k" is encoded»

The text mentions that the Presburger problem is not decidable and requires more than exponential run time. However, algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. The text also mentions that saying a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. Therefore, there must be some approaches that have been taken to establish solutions in reasonable periods of time.

Despite the intractability of some computational problems, it is still possible to establish solutions in reasonable periods of time by developing algorithms that work well in most cases. This is because not all large cases of a problem are necessarily hard or even most of them.

Context:
[1] «P versus NP problem | there may still be effective approaches to tackling the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many NP-complete problems, such as the knapsack problem, the traveling salesman problem and the Boolean satisfiability problem, that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical average-case complexity (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low. An example is the simplex algorithm in linear programming, which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case time complexity it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms. Second, there are types of computations which do not conform»
[2] «Corecursion | and only if the initial tree is finite. The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination; this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees. Another particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling. The function codice_8 visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion, and replaces each label with an integer, each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one. This solution employs a self-referential data structure, and the binary tree can be finite or infinite. An apomorphism (such»
[3] «Divide-and-conquer algorithm | approach allows more freedom in the choice of the sub-problem that is to be solved next, a feature that is important in some applications — e.g. in breadth-first recursion and the branch-and-bound method for function optimization. This approach is also the standard solution in programming languages that do not provide support for recursive procedures. In recursive implementations of D&C algorithms, one must make sure that there is sufficient memory allocated for the recursion stack, otherwise the execution may fail because of stack overflow. D&C algorithms that are time-efficient often have relatively small recursion depth. For example, the quicksort algorithm can»
[4] «Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm | is an example of the general technique of divide and conquer algorithms; in many traditional implementations, however, the explicit recursion is avoided, and instead one traverses the computational tree in breadth-first fashion. The above re-expression of a size-"N" DFT as two size-"N"/2 DFTs is sometimes called the Danielson–Lanczos lemma, since the identity was noted by those two authors in 1942 (influenced by Runge's 1903 work). They applied their lemma in a "backwards" recursive fashion, repeatedly "doubling" the DFT size until the transform spectrum converged (although they apparently didn't realize the linearithmic [i.e., order "N" log "N"] asymptotic complexity they had»
[5] «Branch and bound | FIFO queue-based implementation yields a breadth-first search. A stack (LIFO queue) will yield a depth-first algorithm. A best-first branch and bound algorithm can be obtained by using a priority queue that sorts nodes on their -value. Examples of best-first search algorithms with this premise are Dijkstra's algorithm and its descendent A* search. The depth-first variant is recommended when no good heuristic is available for producing an initial solution, because it quickly produces full solutions, and therefore upper bounds. When formula_1 is a vector of formula_2, branch and bound algorithms can be combined with interval analysis and contractor techniques in order»

[1] «Computational complexity theory | an important result, the so-called speed-up theorem. The field began to flourish in 1971 when the Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin proved the existence of practically relevant problems that are NP-complete. In 1972, Richard Karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete. In the 1980s, much work was done on the average difficulty of solving NP-complete problems—both exactly and approximately. At that time, computational complexity theory was at its height, and it was»
[2] «Karp's 21 NP-complete problems | Karp's 21 NP-complete problems In computational complexity theory, Karp's 21 NP-complete problems are a set of computational problems which are NP-complete. In his 1972 paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", Richard Karp used Stephen Cook's 1971 theorem that the boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete (also called the Cook-Levin theorem) to show that there is a polynomial time many-one reduction from the boolean satisfiability problem to each of 21 combinatorial and graph theoretical computational problems, thereby showing that they are all NP-complete. This was one of the first demonstrations that many natural computational problems occurring throughout computer science are computationally intractable, and»
[3] «Cook–Levin theorem | for Boolean satisfiability exists is thus equivalent to the P versus NP problem, which is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science.

British qualified accountants are full voting members of United Kingdom professional bodies that evaluate individual experience and test competencies for accountants. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 exempts certain professionals, including lawyers, accountants, engineers, and teachers, from being considered investment advisers under certain circumstances. Professional corporations are corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, engineers, public accountants and physicians.

Answer: Chartered or CPA accountants are generally considered on the same level as physicians, lawyers, engineers, and other licensed professionals.

Context:
[1] «Steam engine | Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably»
[2] «Steam locomotive | Not only was this valve tamper-proof, but tampering by the driver could only have the effect of easing pressure. George Richardson's safety valve was an American invention introduced in 1875, and was designed to release the steam only at the moment when the pressure attained the maximum permitted. This type of valve is in almost universal use at present. Britain's Great Western Railway was a notable exception to this rule, retaining the direct-loaded type until the end of its separate existence, because it was considered that such a valve lost less pressure between opening and closing. The earliest locomotives did»
[3] «Steam locomotive | to prevent the weighted lever from bouncing when the locomotive ran over irregularities in the track, thus wasting steam, the weight was later replaced by a more stable spring-loaded column, often supplied by Salter, a well-known spring scale manufacturer. The danger of these devices was that the driving crew could be tempted to add weight to the arm to increase pressure. Most early boilers were fitted with a tamper-proof "lockup" direct-loaded ball valve protected by a cowl. In the late 1850s, John Ramsbottom introduced a safety valve that became popular in Britain during the latter part of the 19th century.»
[4] «Safety valve | or accidentally released. On the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the safety valve tended to go off when the engine hit a bump in the track. A valve less sensitive to sudden accelerations used a spring to contain the steam pressure, but these (based on a Salter spring balance) could still be screwed down to increase the pressure beyond design limits. This dangerous practice was sometimes used to marginally increase the performance of a steam engine. In 1856, John Ramsbottom invented a tamper-proof spring safety valve that became universal on railways. The Ramsbottom valve consisted of two plug-type valves connected to»

In a famous early explosion at Greenwich in 1803, one of Trevithick's high-pressure stationary engines exploded when the boy trained to operate the engine left it to catch eels in the river, without first releasing the safety valve from its working load. By 1806, Trevithick was fitting pairs of safety valves, one external valve for the driver's adjustment and one sealed inside the boiler with a fixed weight. This was unadjustable and released at a higher pressure, intended as a guarantee»

The question is asking about a country that was not allowed to use the airfields of both the UK and France, which resulted in a disruption in their oil supply. The context mentions several historical events where countries denied access to their airfields, including the Falklands War and Battle of the Heligoland Bight.

The only context that mentions a disruption in oil supply is the one about Frejus Airport, where Italian-occupied France did not allow the Italian Royal Air Force to use the airfield.

Context:
[1] «Apollo program | All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12, included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans. Dr. Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the Apollo landing crews. NASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, given for "distinguished service, ability, or»

On one, they walked to the Surveyor, photographed it, and removed some parts which they returned to Earth. The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander, with two rookies. Apollo 13 launched Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise in April 1970, headed for the Fra Mauro formation. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM»
[3] «STS-26 | was also the first all-veteran crew mission since Apollo 11, with all of its crew members having flown at least one prior mission. The crew roster for STS-26 was based on the original crew assignment for STS-61-F, which would have launched the "Ulysses" probe from "Challenger" in 1986. "Ulysses" was eventually launched on STS-41. Hauck, Lounge and Hilmers were all assigned to that flight, with Roy D. Bridges, Jr. as pilot. Bridges never flew again after the "Challenger" disaster, but would eventually become the Director of Langley Research Center. Covey was the CAPCOM operator during the STS-51-L launch who uttered»

An effect of this was that while the CMP usually occupied the center couch on takeoff, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained in it before Collins arrived. Apollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew on an American mission, the first being that of Apollo 10. An all-veteran crew would not be flown again until STS-26 in 1988.

However, after the cancellations of Apollos 18 and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled to serve as members of the backup crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the Skylab program where they flew on Skylab 4.

After the landing by Apollo 12, Apollo 20, which would have been the final manned mission to the Moon, was canceled to allow Skylab to launch as a "dry workshop" (assembled on the ground in an unused S-IVB Saturn IB second stage).

About the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs»

Low announced that the final three Moon landings were rescheduled for 1973 and 1974, following the three planned Skylab missions. Chief Astronaut Deke Slayton moved Don L.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state.

This landmark judgement completely changed the way footballers are employed, allowing professional players in the European Union (except for Malta where the illegal parameter system at the end of contract is still legal) to move freely to another club at the end of their contract with their present team.

After a five-year legal battle, Bosman won his case on 15 December 1995 when the European Court of Justice ruled that players should legally be free to move when their contract expired.

Haffer proposed the explanation for speciation was the product of rainforest patches being separated by stretches of non forest vegetation during the last glacial period. He called these patches of rainforest areas refuges and within these patches allopatric speciation occurred. With the end of the glacial period and increase in atmospheric humidity, rainforest began to expand and the refuges reconnected. This theory has been the subject of debate.

One computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100. However, simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases.

In a "business as usual" scenario, paving the BR-319 and AM-174 highways will result in the loss of large areas of forest. The Juma RDS was created by the government of Amazonas as part of an effort to prevent this happening. The potential loss of revenue from forestry was offset by funds from the Juma REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest»

This results in less soil frost, which in combination with higher levels of direct sunlight results in snowmelt occurring earlier in the spring and earlier peak runoff. The world's rain forests could completely vanish in a hundred years at the current rate of deforestation. Between June 2000 and June 2008 more than 150 000 square kilometers of rain forest were cleared in the Brazilian Amazon. Huge areas of forest have already been lost. For example, only eight to fourteen percent of the Atlantic Forest in South America now remains. While deforestation rates have slowed since 2004, forest loss is»

Some climate models operating with interactive vegetation predict a large loss of Amazonian rainforest around 2050 due to drought, forest dieback and the subsequent release of more carbon dioxide. Five million years from now, the Amazon rainforest may long since have dried and transformed itself into savannah, killing itself in the progress (changes such as this may happen even if all human deforestation activity ceases overnight).

Up to 90% of West Africa's coastal rainforests have disappeared since 1900. In South Asia, about 88% of the rainforests have been lost. Much of what remains of the world's rainforests is in the Amazon basin, where the Amazon Rainforest covers approximately 4 million square kilometres. The regions with the highest tropical deforestation rate between 2000 and 2005 were Central America—which lost 1.3% of its forests each year—and tropical Asia. In Central America, two-thirds of lowland tropical forests have been turned into»

The question asks for an organization that argued that drought could cause the Amazon forest to reach a "tipping point." The sources mention several organizations, but only one argues specifically about the combination of drought and deforestation pushing the rainforest towards a "tipping point" where it would irreversibly start to die. This organization also works to document and publicize the devastating impacts of a dam on the Xingu River and the current rate of deforestation on the Amazon rainforest. Therefore, the organization that argued that drought, among other effects, could cause the Amazon forest to reach a "tipping point" is likely related to the conservation of the Amazon rainforest and the protection of local and indigenous populations.

Layered-mantle convection proponents hold that the mantle's convective activity is layered, separated by densest-packing phase transitions of minerals like olivine, garnet and pyroxene to more dense crystal structures (spinel and then silicate perovskite and post-perovskite).

----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If a fault penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Therefore, if rock formations are found on top of a fault that have not been cut, then they must be younger than the fault.

As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found.

These amounts can vary significantly between samples, ranging up to 1% of the ratio found in living organisms, a concentration comparable to an apparent age of 40,000.

[1] «Geology | Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the»
[2] «Geology | structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates. When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which causes deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones.»

When a sequence of layered rocks is shortened parallel to its layering, this deformation may be accommodated in a number of ways, homogeneous shortening, reverse faulting or folding. The response depends on the thickness of the mechanical layering and the contrast in properties between the layers. If the layering does begin to fold, the fold style is also dependent on these properties. Isolated thick competent layers in a less competent matrix control the folding and typically generate classic rounded buckle folds accommodated by deformation in the matrix.

Context:
[1] «Geology | Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the»
[2] «Geology | structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates. When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which causes deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones.»

Sheath folds form in areas where rocks react differently to simple shear due to variations in competence across layers. The hinge line is severely bent in sheath fold.

When a sequence of layered rocks is shortened parallel to its layering, this deformation may be accommodated in a number of ways, homogeneous shortening, reverse faulting or folding. The response depends on the thickness of the mechanical layering and the contrast in properties between the layers.

Ingres' contemporaries considered the work to signify Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism. "Grande Odalisque" attracted wide criticism when it was first shown. It is renowned for the elongated proportions and lack of anatomical realism. The work is owned by the Louvre Museum, Paris which purchased the work in 1899. The painting was commissioned by Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples, and finished in 1814. Ingres»

The painting was exhibited at the 1846 Bonne-Nouvelle exhibition alongside Ingres' 1814 "Grande Odalisque" and 1842 "Odalisque with Slave", where all three works were praised by the French poet Charles Baudelaire for their "voluptuousness"; after the show he described Ingres as the quintessential painter of women, and described such portraits as the artist's highest accomplishments. The painting remained in the family's private possession for eighty years, though it was displayed publicly on occasion. Its first Paris exhibition in 1846 created "a storm of approval among her»

Caroline was an art lover, and in 1814 commissioned a number of paintings from Ingres, her favored artist. These include his "Grande Odalisque", it's now lost sister piece "La Dormeuse de Naples", and "Paolo and Francesca". The painting was completed shortly before the 1815 collapse of the Naples regime after Napoleon's empire crumbled following his defeat of the Battle of Waterloo. Joachim was executed by firing squad in October of that year (his wife lived until 1839). Consequently, Ingres's was not paid for his earlier commissions.»
[4] «Odalisque with Slave | Odalisque with Slave Odalisque with Slave (French: "L'Odalisque à l'esclave") is an 1839 painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres commissioned by Charles Marcotte. Executed in oil on canvas, it depicts a nude odalisque, a musician, and a eunuch in a harem interior. The painting is in the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is a classic piece of Orientalism in French painting. Ingres painted a number of harem scenes during his long career, starting with the "Grande Odalisque" (1814). These works exemplify a taste for Orientalist subject matter shared by many French painters of the Romantic era, notably Ingres' rival Eugène»

Murat's wife and queen consort Caroline commissioned the 1814 "la Grande Odalisque" as a pendant for the painting, on a canvas of the same dimensions. "La Dormeuse de Naples" disappeared in 1815 after the royal palace in Naples was pillaged following Murat's fall from power. It is only known through its preparatory studies, a drawing made from memory by Ingres and an old photograph of a study for it. In 1832 Ingres asked Caroline Murat about the painting»

The relevant sources mention several carriage disputes involving ABC and Time Warner Cable, but the correct answer is found in [3], which explains that networks rely on affiliates to carry their programming because FCC regulations limit the number of network-owned stations as a percentage of total national market reach. 

Answer: ABC does not have a cable provider that carries its owned-and-operated stations in ABC O&O markets. ABC relies on affiliates to carry its programming because of FCC regulations.

The law requires a specified, minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometers) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy for dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices.

Answer: 1.6 kilometers.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we know that in Austria, there is a separation of prescribing and dispensing for general physicians. However, if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away or if none is registered in the city, physicians are allowed to dispense drugs themselves. We also know that the law requires a minimum distance between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy for dispensing physicians in rural areas in the United Kingdom. Therefore, to answer the question, we need to find out the minimum distance required for a patient's home and the nearest pharmacy in Austria.

Answer: The sources do not provide a clear answer to this question.

In Austria, the law separates prescribing and dispensing drugs, except for general physicians in certain circumstances. In rural areas of the UK, there are dispensing physicians who can both prescribe and dispense drugs. The law requires a minimum distance between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy. According to the sources, the distance in the UK is currently 1.6 kilometers. 

Answer: 1.6 kilometers.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify where in the sources we can find information about the minimum distance between a patient's home and the nearest pharmacy. Upon scanning the sources, we can see that [1] and [2] mention this requirement in relation to dispensing physicians in rural areas. Specifically, [2] states that there is a specified minimum distance of currently 1.6 kilometers between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy. Therefore, the answer is:

In Austria, physicians are allowed to dispense drugs themselves if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away. The law requires a designated rural area and a specified minimum distance between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy. 

Answer: 4 kilometers.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
In Austria, the law requires the separation of prescribing and dispensing, but there are exceptions for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away. The law aims to prevent patient exploitation and ensure patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere. In rural areas of the United Kingdom, there are dispensing physicians allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines from within their practices if the GP practice is located in a designated rural area and there is a specified minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometers) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy.

The question asks what substance is released by the matching helper T cell when it binds with the MHC:antigen complex of the B cell. According to the sources, the activated B cell begins to divide and its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes the antigen. The B cell displays the antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules, which attracts a matching helper T cell. The memory T helper cells recognize and bind the MHC-II-peptide complexes through their T cell receptor (TCR). Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide binding, T cells express the surface protein CD40L as well as cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-21. CD40L serves as

Context:
[1] «Egregore | then as a noun, while leaving the meaning obscure. The author seems to have needed a word rhyming with words ending in the sound "or". It would not be the only example of word creation by Victor Hugo. However, the word is the normal form that the Greek word ἑγρήγορος (Watcher) would take in French. This was the term used in the Book of Enoch for great angel-like spirits. Eliphas Lévi, in "Le Grand Arcane" ("The Great Mystery", 1868) identifies "egregors" with the tradition concerning the "Watchers", the fathers of the nephilim, describing them as "terrible beings" that "crush us»
[2] «Stanisław Lem's fictitious criticism of nonexisting books | intended continuation of Lem's work; rather he had a number of ideas he didn't have time to develop in full. Some critics asserted that the latter reason was behind Lem's pseudepigraphy as well. When this opinion was brought to Lem's attention, he denied that. The Agora SA edition also contained the "Glossary of Lem's Terminology" ("Słownik terminów Lemowskich") based on the book "Co to są sepulki? Wszystko o Lemie (2007)" by Wojciech Orliński. In 1973 Lem published a book , a collection of introductions to books supposedly to be written in the future, in the 21st century. One of those»

Still Villon's verse is mostly about his own life, a record of poverty, trouble, and trial which was certainly shared by his poems' intended audience. In 1461, at the age of thirty, Villon composed the longer work which came to be known as "Le grand testament" (1461–1462). This has generally been judged Villon's»
[4] «Le Spleen de Paris | For Baudelaire, the accessibility of the text and ability for a reader to set down the book and pick it up much later was crucial, especially considering his implied opinions of his readers. Baudelaire's tone throughout the preface, "The Dog and the Vial" as well as other poems throughout "Le Spleen de Paris" seem to illustrate Baudelaire's opinions of superiority over his readers. In "The Dog and the Vial", a man offers his dog a vial of fancy perfume to smell and the dog reacts in horror, instead wishing to sniff more seemingly unappealing smells, specifically excrement. The poem concludes»
[5] «Lucien François | complicated structures of juridical systems from facts alone. The book's first part, Prolégomènes, consists of seven short chapters in which the author claims that concepts commonly used in the so-called theory of law are inadequate and concludes that it is best not to use the term "law" at all. In the third part, entitled Epilogue, François reconsiders his approach and summarizes what has been achieved. The second part is the book's core, titled Exercice sur le jurème. Its main title By Agreement or by Force encapsulates the essential way in which law works. In the eighth chapter the author constructs»

Context:
[1] «Construction | the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger firms. Presently, a firm that is nominally an "architecture" or "construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may offer itself as "one-stop shopping" for a construction project, from beginning to end. This is designated as a "design build" contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction,»
[2] «Project finance | of data variations. The typical project finance documentation can be reconducted to four main types: The most common project finance construction contract is the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract. An EPC contract generally provides for the obligation of the contractor to build and deliver the project facilities on a fixed price, turnkey basis, i.e., at a certain pre-determined fixed price, by a certain date, in accordance with certain specifications, and with certain performance warranties. The EPC contract is quite complicated in terms of legal issue, therefore the project company and the EPC contractor need sufficient experience and knowledge of»
[3] «Complex Projects Contract | traditional drawings, specification and/or bills of quantities, or BIM, or on projects which require a contractor’s design in part, or for design-build projects in which the contractor designs the whole of the works with or without an employer’s reference design. The contract requires a collaborative approach to the management of design, quality, time and cost. The working schedule, planning method statement and progress records (which are to be inspected and accepted by a competent project time manager and independently audited for quality assurance) are at the core of management. They are the tools by which all time and time-related cost»
[4] «Construction | while adhering to the performance specifications. Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including design-build, partnering and construction management. In general, each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects, interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and construction. In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process. The increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of the project's life-cycle and develop»
[5] «Performance bond | job is awarded to the winning bid, a payment and performance bond will then be required as a security to the job completion. For example, a contractor may cause a performance bond to be issued in favour of a client for whom the contractor is constructing a building. If the contractor fails to construct the building according to the specifications laid out by the contract (most often due to the bankruptcy of the contractor), the client is guaranteed compensation for any monetary loss up to the amount of the performance bond. Performance bonds are commonly used in the construction and»

[1] «Construction | and "impure" or "strategic" alliances. The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry. This is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized. In this arrangement, the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator.

[2] «Competition (companies) | Michael Porter, "A nation's competitiveness depends on the capacity of its industry to innovate and upgrade." Advocates for policies that focus on increasing competition argue that enacting only protectionist measures can cause atrophy of domestic industry by insulating them from global forces. They further argue that protectionism is often a temporary fix to larger, underlying problems: the declining efficiency and quality of domestic manufacturing. American competition advocacy began to gain significant traction in Washington policy debates in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of increasing pressure on the United States Congress to introduce and pass legislation increasing»

The management will emphasise on increasing equipment and technological investments rather than improving infrastructures like planning and measurement systems and workforce policies. Companies would have long-term goals to achieve industry standards. The focus will be on productivity enhancement and economies of scale meeting standard practice. Companies would favour capital investments as the means for gaining competitive advantage. Their main aim is competitive parity in the manufacturing process. The business strategy»
[4] «Construction communication | and a lack of mutual respect and trust, all combine to hinder open communication and render the role of the project manager extremely demanding and problematic. Nevertheless, addressing communication in the industry can be seen as a principal enabler for improving the industry in the future. Since the early 1940s, literature on communication in construction has appeared, mainly based on the situation in the UK. Many problems concerning communication have been reported, with a focus on intra-supplier communication within the construction sector; demand-supply communication during the design phase; and communication between and within single demand and supply side parties, during»

Lawyers differ on whether the process should be seen as strictly adversarial, in order to ensure they retain the trust of clients and the overall process retains the trust of society, or whether the ethics of the larger society should play a role in their behavior. A third example of an adversarial process is the operation of market systems, e.g. commodity markets. In these, bid and ask prices are constantly compared, with sellers representing goods as being valuable and buyers haggling and claiming they are less valuable. Product markets tend to focus on the comparison of sellers' products»

Question: What does many workers willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers result in?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The passage mentions that some jobs have low market demand or uncertainty and require extremely hard work with little guarantee of reward. The rewards for these jobs are set high as a result of rational choice to exploit the overwhelming gain paradox. This means that the competition for these jobs is high, and many workers are willing to work for a lot of time to compete for them, even though the jobs only require a few workers.

Answer: High rewards for jobs with low market demand or uncertainty result in many workers willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If there are many workers willing to work for a job that only requires a few workers, it will result in a lower salary or wage for that job. 

Answer: Lower salary/wage.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If there are many workers willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers, it will result in a lower wage for that job. This is because the employers can choose from a large pool of workers and select the ones who are willing to work for less. 

Answer: Lower wage.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If there are many workers willing to work for a job that only requires a few workers, then the competition for that job is high. This can result in lower wages for the workers because the employer has many options to choose from. 

Answer: Lower wages.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If many workers are willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers, it means that the job is in high demand and there are more workers than available positions. This can result in a high level of competition for the job, potentially leading to lower wages or less favorable working conditions.

Answer: High competition for a job with few available positions can result in lower wages or less favorable working conditions.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If there are many workers willing to work for a job that only requires a few workers, then there is an oversupply of labor. This oversupply of labor drives down wages and benefits, making it difficult for workers to make a decent living. The result is a situation where workers are competing for jobs that pay less than they are worth, leading to a decrease in job satisfaction and quality of life.

Answer: Decreased job satisfaction and quality of life.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If there are many workers willing to work for a job that only requires a few workers, this will result in a lower salary or wage for that job. This is due to the basic economic principle of supply and demand, where a surplus of supply (workers) leads to a decrease in demand (salary/wage). 

Answer: Lower salary/wage.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
If many workers are willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers, it results in a high demand for the job. This high demand allows employers to offer lower wages and fewer benefits. 

Answer: Lower wages and fewer benefits.

...................................assistant...................................
This question is asking about the result of a situation where many workers are willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers. The text mentions this scenario in [5], where the author argues that jobs that require a lot of hard work with little guarantee of reward have high rewards set as a result of the overwhelming gain paradox. This suggests that when there are more workers than jobs available, the rewards for the job increase due to competition.

Answer: Increased job rewards due to competition.

...................................assistant...................................
If many workers are willing to work for a lot of time competing for a job that only requires a few workers, then this would result in a high demand for the job. As a result, the rewards for these jobs would be set high due to the overwhelming gain paradox. 

Answer: High rewards for jobs with high demand.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
- The article mentions that some jobs require extremely hard work with little guarantee of reward.
- These jobs have low market demand or uncertainty.
- However, some workers are still willing to compete for these jobs.
- As a result, the rewards for these jobs are set high.
- This is due to a rational choice to exploit the overwhelming gain paradox.

Answer: High rewards for jobs with low market demand or uncertainty.

...................................assistant...................................
Workers competing for a limited number of high-paying jobs leads to those jobs becoming more lucrative, as employers can be choosier and offer lower wages. This is due to the overwhelming gain paradox, where the potential rewards of a job outweigh the likelihood of obtaining them, leading people to work hard to qualify.

[1] «Monopsony | If the hypothesis was generally true, one would expect to find that wages decreased as firm size increased or, more accurately, as industry concentration increased. However, numerous statistical studies document significant positive correlations between firm or establishment size and wages. These results are often explained as being the result of cross-industry competition. For example, if there were only one fast food producer, that industry would be very consolidated. But that company wouldn't be able to drive down wages via monopsonistic power if it were also competing against retail stores, construction, and other jobs utilizing the same labor skill set. This»
[2] «Iron law of wages | subsistence wage level because without subsistence, laborers will be unable to work. However, competition among laborers for employment will drive wages down to this minimal level. This follows from Malthus' demographic theory, according to which population rises when wages are above the "subsistence wage" and falls when wages are below subsistence. Assuming the demand for labor to be a given monotonically decreasing function of the real wage rate, the theory then predicted that, in the long-run equilibrium of the system, labor supply (i.e. population) will rise or fall to the number of workers needed at the subsistence wage.

Competition between workers drives down wages for jobs with a high supply of workers. However, the question is asking about whose competition drives wages up for the inverse - jobs with a low supply of workers. The answer must be something or someone that is in short supply and therefore in high demand among employers.

Answer: Workers with rare or specialized skills.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The passage in [1] explains that wages often increase as firm or establishment size increases due to cross-industry competition. This means that competition between firms utilizing the same labor skill set can drive wages up. Therefore, the answer must be competition between firms.

Competition between workers drives down wages for jobs with a high supply of workers. However, there must be some other force that drives wages up. Based on the sources provided, one possible answer is competition between employers, as suggested by Benjamin Tucker in source [4].

Answer: Competition between employers.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Competition between workers drives down wages for jobs with a high supply of workers, but whose competition drives wages up for the inverse? The answer must be a type of competition that is not among workers, but rather among employers. This type of competition would result in employers offering higher wages to attract workers, rather than driving wages down through monopsony power. Based on the sources provided, this type of competition is often cited as cross-industry competition, where employers in one industry compete against employers in other industries for the same labor skill set.

Answer: Cross-industry competition.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The passage mentions that competition among laborers drives wages down to the subsistence level, but that competition between firms or industries can drive wages up. This is because if a firm has a monopoly on a certain industry, they can use their monopsonistic power to drive down wages, but if they are competing against other industries for the same labor skill set, they cannot do so as easily. Therefore, the competition between firms or industries can drive wages up for jobs with a lower supply of workers.

Finally, source [5] suggests that competition for resources exacerbated the imbalance between property-owners and workers, leading to demographic stagnation. 

Answer: Cross-industry competition, increased labor productivity, and competition for resources can drive wages up.

An example of the slowdown in education growth in America (that began about the same time as the Great Divergence began) is the fact that the average person born in 1945 received two more years of schooling than his parents, while the average person born in 1975 received only half a year more of schooling.

Context:
[1] «Economic inequality | but from "grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort" Jamie Galbraith argues that countries with larger financial sectors have greater inequality, and the link is not an accident. Economic inequality Economic inequality covers a wide variety of topics. It can refer to either income distribution, measuring the amount of money people are paid, or the distribution of wealth, which captures the amount of wealth people own. Inequality among nations is covered in international inequality and countries listed by income inequality. Besides measurements between countries or states, there are important types of»
[2] «Rent-seeking | the question is whether private provision with free-riding incentives or public provision with rent-seeking incentives is more inefficient in its allocation. The economist Joseph Stiglitz has argued that rent-seeking contributes significantly to income inequality in the United States through lobbying for government policies that let the wealthy and powerful get income, not as a reward for creating wealth, but by grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort. Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva have analyzed international economies and their changes in tax rates to conclude that much of income inequality is a result»
[3] «Wealth | wealth creation as the combination of materials, labour, land, and technology in such a way as to capture a profit (excess above the cost of production). The theories of David Ricardo, John Locke, John Stuart Mill, in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics. Marxian economics ("see labor theory of value") distinguishes in the "Grundrisse" between material wealth and human wealth, defining human wealth as "wealth in human relations"; land and labour were the source of all material wealth. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta links wealth/poverty to rationality.»
[4] «Income | the interest created by capital, and profits from entrepreneurial ventures. From labor services, as well as ownership of land and capital. In consumer theory 'income' is another name for the "budget constraint," an amount formula_1 to be spent on different goods x and y in quantities formula_2 and formula_3 at prices formula_4 and formula_5. The basic equation for this is This equation implies two things. First buying one more unit of good x implies buying formula_7 less units of good y. So, formula_7 is the "relative" price of a unit of x as to the number of units given up»
[5] «Independent income | Independent income Independent income is a stream of income received without directly exchanging labour power for it. Examples are interest on money capital, dividends earned by share ownership, rental income, etc. Many economists and other professionals consider that there is a need in modern capitalist economies for policies that encourage the acquisition of income generating capital assets that supplement or replace employment generated income. This need, it is argued, is driven by the progressive replacement of labour by capital in modern production. Traditional economic theory counters this by contending that employment created in the growing service sector can absorb labour»

Context:
[1] «Effects of economic inequality | effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. According to International Monetary Fund economists, inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth). High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education. According to IMF staff economists, "if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting»
[2] «Effects of economic inequality | that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels." However, further work done in 2015 by Sutirtha Bagchia and Jan Svejnar suggests that it is only inequality caused by corruption and cronyism that harms growth. When they control for the fact that some inequality is caused by billionaires using their political connections, then inequality caused by market forces does not»
[3] «Progressive tax | and economic growth. Describing the research, William McBride, a staff writer with the Tax Foundation, stated that progressivity can undermine investment, risk-taking, entrepreneurship, and productivity because high-income earners tend to do much of the saving, investing, risk-taking, and high-productivity labor. According to IMF, some advanced economies could increase progressivity in taxation for tackling inequality, without hampering growth, as long as progressivity is not excessive. Fund also states that the average top income tax rate for OECD member countries fell from 62 percent in 1981 to 35 percent in 2015, and that in addition, tax systems are less progressive than indicated»
[4] «Economic growth | rate. As a consequence, growth in the model can occur either by increasing the share of GDP invested or through technological progress. But at whatever share of GDP invested, capital/worker eventually converges on the steady state, leaving the growth rate of output/worker determined only by the rate of technological progress. As a consequence, with world technology available to all and progressing at a constant rate, all countries have the same steady state rate of growth. Each country has a different level of GDP/worker determined by the share of GDP it invests, but all countries have the same rate of economic»

In line with the predictions of the model, they find that at the 25th percentile of initial income in the world sample, a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient increases income per capita by 2.3%, whereas at the 75th percentile of initial income a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient decreases income per capita by -5.3%.»

Context:
[1] «Goldbach's conjecture | has not just one representation as the sum of two primes, but in fact has very many such representations. This heuristic argument is actually somewhat inaccurate, because it assumes that the events of "m" and "n" − "m" being prime are statistically independent of each other.

The connection between the harmonic series and primes involves the fact that the series diverges. This is because the series can be compared to the sum of the reciprocals of the primes, which also diverges. This comparison is known as the divergence of the harmonic series test. The proof involves assuming that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes is finite and showing that this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the harmonic series diverges and there must be an infinite number of primes.

Answer: The divergence of the harmonic series shows that there is an infinite number of primes.

The connection between the harmonic series and primes is related to a specific result called the Euler-Mascheroni constant, which is defined as the limit of the difference between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm function. This constant has been shown to have a close relationship with the distribution of prime numbers. Specifically, it has been proven that if the series of reciprocals of primes diverges (i.e. if there are infinitely many primes), then the Euler-Mascheroni constant is irrational. Conversely, if the Euler-Mascheroni constant is irrational, then the series of reciprocals of primes must diverge. Therefore, the fact that the harmonic series diverges implies that there are infinitely many primes.

There is a famous proof by Euler that shows that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, which means that there are infinitely many primes. This proof involves comparing the harmonic series to the sum of the reciprocals of the primes. So the property of the harmonic series that shows there are infinitely many primes is its divergence.

Answer: Divergence

The proof that the harmonic series diverges uses a method called the "p-series test," which compares the series to the series 1/n^p. When p=1, the series diverges. But when p>1, the series converges. The proof for why p=1 is used involves grouping terms in a certain way. This grouping shows that the sum of the series is greater than or equal to the sum of the series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + ..., which is equal to 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + ... This series

The harmonic series is divergent. The divergence of the harmonic series can be proven by comparison with the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + ..., which also diverges. This comparison shows that the sum of the first n terms of the harmonic series grows at least as fast as the logarithm of n. The divergence of the harmonic series implies that there are an infinite number of terms in the series that are greater than any fixed number, such as 1. This in turn implies that there are an infinite number of primes, by Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes.

Specifically, it has to do with the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes is divergent, while the sum of the reciprocals of the composite numbers is finite. This can be shown using the Euler product formula and the fact that every composite number has a prime factorization.

Answer: The divergence of the harmonic series implies that there are an infinite number of primes.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The fact that the harmonic series diverges means that the sum of its terms goes to infinity. It turns out that this property is related to the distribution of primes in the number line. Specifically, if we consider the reciprocals of all prime numbers (i.e., 1/p for all primes p), and sum them up, we get a series that diverges as well. This is known as the "sum of the reciprocals of primes" or the "prime harmonic series." Therefore, the divergence of the harmonic series implies that there are infinitely many primes.

Answer: Infinitely many primes.

The connection between the harmonic series and primes involves the divergence of the harmonic series. Specifically, it involves the fact that if you remove all terms from the series that have prime denominators, the resulting series still diverges. This can be proven using the fact that every positive integer can be uniquely factored into primes.

----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The fact that there is an infinite number of primes is related to the divergence of the harmonic series. This was first proven by Euler. The proof goes as follows: assume the opposite, that there is a finite number of primes. Then you can write the product of all primes as a finite number, let's call it "N". But then the sum of the reciprocals of all the primes, which is the same as the harmonic series, is less than or equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the first "N" natural numbers, which is a finite number. This contradicts the fact that the harmonic series diverges. Therefore, there must be an infinite number of primes.

...................................assistant...................................
The connection between the harmonic series and primes is related to the divergence of the series. The proof of the divergence of the harmonic series involves a comparison with a series of reciprocals of primes. This comparison shows that the sum of the reciprocals of primes diverges, which implies that there are infinitely many primes.

...................................assistant...................................
The connection between the harmonic series and prime numbers is related to the divergence of the series. The proof of the divergence of the harmonic series uses a method that involves finding a lower bound for the sum of the series that is greater than or equal to ln(n). This method is based on the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes is greater than or equal to ln(ln(n)), which implies that there are infinitely many primes.

Answer: The divergence of the harmonic series implies that there are infinitely many primes.

...................................assistant...................................
The statement that the harmonic series shows that there is an infinite number of primes is known as the "proof" by Leonhard Euler. This proof involves assuming that there is a finite number of primes and then showing that the harmonic series would converge, which contradicts the fact that it diverges. Therefore, the fact that the harmonic series diverges shows that there must be an infinite number of primes.

Answer: The divergence of the harmonic series shows that there is an infinite number of primes.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 16 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
There is a famous proof attributed to Euler that shows that the harmonic series diverges. This proof relies on a property of the series that involves prime numbers. Specifically, the proof shows that for each prime number "p," there exists a positive integer "n" such that the sum of the reciprocals of the first "n" natural numbers is greater than or equal to the sum of the reciprocals of all natural numbers greater than or equal to "p." This property is important because it allows us to conclude that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Answer: The harmonic series has a property that involves prime numbers, which shows that there are infinitely many primes.

There is a proof that shows that if the harmonic series diverges, then there must be an infinite number of primes. This proof was first given by Euler. 

Answer: Divergence
----------------------------------- CHOICE 18 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The connection between the harmonic series and primes comes from the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes is divergent. This is because any finite sum of reciprocals of primes is less than the sum of the first "n" terms of the harmonic series, which is known to be divergent. Therefore, if the sum of the reciprocals of the primes is finite, then there must be a largest prime, which is a contradiction. Thus, there must be an infinite number of primes.

Answer: The sum of the reciprocals of the primes is divergent.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 19 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question asks about a property of the harmonic series. It is known that the sum of the reciprocals of primes is infinite, and this fact is related to the divergence of the harmonic series. Therefore, the property of the harmonic series that shows there is an infinite number of primes is its divergence.

The question is asking for the name of a conjecture related to pairs of consecutive primes. The clue is that it involves a positive integer "n" and that the difference between the primes is 2n. Looking through the provided sources, we can eliminate options [2], [3], and [4] as they do not mention consecutive primes with a specific difference. Option [1] mentions the twin prime conjecture, which involves consecutive primes with a difference of 2, but not a specific multiple of 2. Option [5], Brocard's conjecture, involves finding at least four primes between two consecutive squares, and mentions that Legendre's conjecture implies there are at least two primes between consecutive prime squares.

Context:
[1] «Wilson's theorem | − 1)! is congruent to 0 (mod "n"). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if "n" can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, , where 2 ≤ "a" < "b" ≤ "n" − 2, then both "a" and "b" will appear in the product and ("n" − 1)! will be divisible by "n". If "n" has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime "q", "q" > 2. But then 2"q" < "q" = "n", both "q" and 2"q" will be factors of ("n" − 1)!, and again "n" divides ("n"»
[2] «Wilson's theorem | residue classes modulo a prime number are a field—see the article prime field for more details. Lagrange's theorem, which states that in any field a polynomial of degree "n" has at most "n" roots, is needed for both proofs. If "n" is composite it is divisible by some prime number "q", where . If were congruent to then it would also be congruent to −1 (mod "q"). But ("n" − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod "q"). In fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3! = 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4), if "n" is composite then ("n"»
[3] «Highly composite number | be highly composite it has to have prime factors as small as possible, but not too many of the same. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every positive integer "n" has a unique prime factorization: where formula_8 are prime, and the exponents formula_9 are positive integers. Any factor of n must have the same or lesser multiplicity in each prime: So the number of divisors of "n" is: Hence, for a highly composite number "n", Also, except in two special cases "n" = 4 and "n" = 36, the last exponent "c" must equal 1. It means that 1, 4,»
[4] «Antisymmetric relation | distinct and "n" is a factor of "m", then "m" cannot be a factor of "n". For example, 12 is divisible by 4, but 4 is not divisible by 12. The usual order relation ≤ on the real numbers is anti-symmetric: if for two real numbers "x" and "y" both inequalities "x" ≤ "y" and "y" ≤ "x" hold then "x" and "y" must be equal. Similarly, the subset order ⊆ on the subsets of any given set is anti-symmetric: given two sets "A" and "B", if every element in "A" also is in "B" and every element in "B"»
[5] «Pollard's p − 1 algorithm | through an accident of random number generation. This terminology is considered obsolete by the cryptography industry. Let "n" be a composite integer with prime factor "p". By Fermat's little theorem, we know that for all integers "a" coprime to "p" and for all positive integers "K": If a number "x" is congruent to 1 modulo a factor of "n", then the will be divisible by that factor. The idea is to make the exponent a large multiple of "p" − 1 by making it a number with very many prime factors; generally, we take the product of all prime powers»

In the equations above formula_31 denotes the probability of formula_2, and formula_33 denotes the base rate (aka. prior probability) of formula_1. The conditional probability formula_35 generalizes the logical statement»
[2] «Full reptend prime | 8"k" + 3 or 8"k" + 5, because if "p" = 8"k" + 1 or 8"k" + 7, then 2 is a quadratic residue modulo "p", so "p" divides formula_6, and the period of formula_2 in base 2 must divide formula_5 and cannot be "p" − 1, so they are not full reptend primes in base 2. Further, all safe primes congruent to 3 (mod 8) are full reptend primes in base 2. For example, 3, 11, 59, 83, 107, 179, 227, 347, 467, 563, 587, 1019, 1187, 1283, 1307, 1523, 1619, 1907, etc. (less than 2000) Binary full reptend»

The assertion that "Q" is necessary for "P" is colloquially equivalent to ""P" cannot be true unless "Q" is true" or "if Q is false, then P is false". By contraposition, this is the same thing as "whenever "P" is true, so is "Q"". The logical relation between "P" and "Q" is expressed as "if "P", then "Q"" and denoted ""P" ⇒ "Q"" ("P" implies»

One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition, as shown in Example 5. If "P" is sufficient for "Q", then knowing "P" to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that "Q" is true; however, knowing "P" to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that "Q" is false.

In terms of the discriminant "D" of "L", and taking still "K" = Q, no prime "p" must divide "D" to the power "p". Then Noether's theorem states that tame ramification is necessary and sufficient for "O" to be a projective module over Z["G"]. It is certainly therefore necessary for it to be a "free" module.»

Moreover, in 2011 and 2012, the United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society called on all United Methodists to abstain from alcohol for Lent. The United Methodist Church, along with some other Methodist churches, condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life. The Church also holds that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalized persons including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with mental and emotional illnesses. The United Methodist Church also believes that Jesus explicitly repudiated the "lex»

Initially, the issue taken was limited to distilled liquors, but quickly evolved into teetotalism and Methodists were commonly known to abstain from all alcoholic beverages. In 1880, the general conference included in the Discipline a broad statement which included, "Temperance is a Christian virtue, Scripturally enjoined." Due to the temperate stance of the church, the practice of Eucharist was altered — to this day, Methodist churches most commonly use grape juice symbolically during Communion rather than wine. The Methodist church distinguished itself from many other»

The General Board of Church and Society petitioned the D.C. Superior Court to ratify its interpretation of the 1965 trust document. At trial the District of Columbia Superior Court ruled in favor of GBCS. The United Methodist Building now houses the Washington offices of a number of faith related organizations as they work in is issue based coalitions to address critical social concerns and present a common voice to congressional offices and the US administration.

In May 2012 at the General Conference of the United Methodist Church (UMC), "Lifewatch" encouraged legislation to direct two church agencies—the General Board of Church and Society and United Methodist Women—to withdraw from the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC). Along with other mainline Protestant and religious counterparts, the two UMC agencies formed RCRC in 1973, then known as the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights (RCAR). Until 1993, RCAR operated from the United Methodist Building across from the United States Supreme Court Building where Harry Blackmun,»

The motion was approved with a 425-268 vote difference. Statements of resignation were subsequently issued by both Church and Society and United Methodist Women.

[1] «Friction | can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as "μ", is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise as the result of surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for only a fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area.

[2] «Force | where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force "exactly" balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object. A static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances. For example, an object»
[3] «Collision response | between two bodies in static contact, the surfaces must somehow lift away from each other. Once in motion, the degree of surface affinity is reduced and hence bodies in sliding motion tend to offer lesser resistance to motion. These two categories of friction are respectively termed "static friction" and "dynamic friction". It is a Force which is applied to an object by another object or by a person. The direction of the applied force depends on how the force is applied. It is the support force exerted upon an object which is in contact with another stable object.Normal force is»
[4] «Force | is directly related to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: static friction and kinetic friction. The static friction force (formula_56) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the coefficient of static friction (formula_57) multiplied by the normal force (formula_58). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality: The kinetic friction force (formula_60) is independent of both the forces applied and the movement of the object.»
[5] «Friction | sliding true contact, and existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy, work must be spent in creating the new surface, and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is required to move the back of the contact, and frictional heat is released at the front. For certain applications it is more useful to define static friction in terms of the maximum angle before which one of the items will begin sliding. This is called the "angle of friction" or "friction angle". It is defined as: where»

Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which»
