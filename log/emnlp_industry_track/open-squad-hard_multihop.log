- The relations between the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet Union were broken off after the Germans publicized the findings on the Katyn Massacre.
- The Soviet Union agreed to allow the formation of a coalition government composed of the communists and Polish pro-Western elements in exile and in Poland, and subsequently to arrange for free elections to be held.
- The exiled Polish government in London did not trust the Soviet-backed Polish Workers' Party and feared that they would not allow free elections.
- Therefore, they ordered the underground Home Army to seize control of Warsaw prior to the arrival of the Red Army to establish their own authority and prevent the communists from taking over.

[1] «Reduction (complexity) | Reduction (complexity) In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a reduction is an algorithm for transforming one problem into another problem. A reduction from one problem to another may be used to show that the second problem is at least as difficult as the first. Intuitively, problem A is reducible to problem B if an algorithm for solving problem B efficiently (if it existed) could also be used as a subroutine to solve problem A efficiently.

Professions are highly regarded and valued by society because of their vital role in society. They are typically specialized in a specific trade and vow to perform their work to the highest known standard. Licensure is required for many professions, and some professions are restricted to only professionally qualified individuals. Based on this information, we can infer that the answer to the question is a profession that requires licensure and is highly valued by society.

The question is asking about the cytokine released by the matching helper T cell when it binds with the MHC:antigen complex of the B cell. According to the sources, helper T cells release cytokines to help the activity of other immune cells, including B cells. When a B cell encounters an antigen, it waits for a matching helper T cell to bind with the MHC:antigen complex on its surface. This binding activates the T cell, which then releases cytokines that induce B cells to divide rapidly. Therefore, the answer to the question is cytokines.

The two parties involved are one or more owners, and one or more contractors. The owner has full authority to decide what type of contract should be used for a specific development to be constructed and to set forth the legally-binding terms and conditions in a contractual agreement.

The table below presents 2006 income data in terms of the lower thresholds for the given percentages (e.g. the top 25.6% of households had incomes exceeding $80,000, compared to $47,000 for the top quarter of individuals).

The question is asking for a term used by economists to describe income that is not from the creation of wealth but from taking a larger share of it. The context mentions that Jamie Galbraith argues that countries with larger financial sectors have greater inequality, and the link is not an accident. The context also mentions that economic inequality can refer to either income distribution or the distribution of wealth. Therefore, the term used by economists to describe income not from the creation of wealth but by grabbing a larger share of it is likely related to economic inequality.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published several special reports, including the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) in 2000 and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) in 2018. The SRES contains scenarios of future changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide, which are used to project future changes in climate. The SRES scenarios were used in the IPCC's Third and Fourth Assessment Reports. The SREX is another special report by the IPCC that focuses on managing risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation.

The SREX is a special report published by the IPCC. The context mentions that two special reports were finalized in 2011, but it does not specify which ones. However, it also mentions that one of the authors of the SREX was a coordinating lead author for that report, which suggests that the SREX was published after 2011. Therefore, we need to look for more information in the context to determine when the SREX was issued.

This heuristic argument is actually somewhat inaccurate, because it assumes that the events of "m" and "n" − "m" being prime are statistically independent of each other. For instance, if "m" is odd then "n" − "m" is also odd, and if "m" is even, then "n" − "m" is even, a non-trivial relation because, besides the number 2, only odd numbers can be prime.

The context discusses the necessary condition for a set of polynomials to simultaneously generate prime values infinitely often. It mentions Bunyakovsky's property and the absence of a prime number that divides their product for every positive integer. It also mentions Schinzel's hypothesis H and the Bateman-Horn conjecture. However, it does not directly state another way to state the condition that infinitely many primes can exist only if a and q are coprime.

This means that if "p" is not congruent to 1 modulo 4, then it cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares.

- Wilson's theorem states that a natural number "n" > 1 is a prime number if and only if the product of all the positive integers less than "n" is one less than a multiple of "n".
- Therefore, if "n" is composite, then the product of all the positive integers less than "n" must not be one less than a multiple of "n".
- In other words, the product of all the positive integers less than "n" must be divisible by "n".
- So, according to Wilson's theorem, if some integer "n" > 4 is to be considered composite, then the factorial of (n-1) must be divisible by "n".

[3] «Friction | can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as "μ", is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise as the result of surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for only a fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives»
[4] «Collision response | between two bodies in static contact, the surfaces must somehow lift away from each other. Once in motion, the degree of surface affinity is reduced and hence bodies in sliding motion tend to offer lesser resistance to motion. These two categories of friction are respectively termed "static friction" and "dynamic friction". It is a Force which is applied to an object by another object or by a person. The direction of the applied force depends on how the force is applied. It is the support force exerted upon an object which is in contact with another stable object.Normal force is»

Static friction is affected by the weight of the object and the characteristics of the surface it is on. The heavier the object, the more static friction it has. The nature of the materials in contact, their surface coatings, the extent of the surface area, the normal pressure, and the length of time that the surfaces remain in contact also affect static friction.

The question is asking about a formula related to rotation about the Earth. The context mentions several formulas related to rotation, including proper time, rotating furnace, and gradian. However, none of these formulas seem to directly relate to gravitational acceleration or mass of the Earth. The context also mentions the Eötvös effect, which does involve gravitational acceleration and the shape of the Earth, but it is not clear if it is the formula being referred to in the question. Therefore, we need to look for more information or context to determine the correct answer.
