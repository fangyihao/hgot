The context provides information about the Electoral College, the U.S. Senate, party conferences, and voting. However, the question is not directly related to any of these topics. Therefore, we need to refine the search query to find relevant information that can answer the question.

Step 1: The question is asking for a specific type of dollar.
Step 2: The question mentions copper alloy, so we need to look for information about dollars made of copper alloys.
Step 3: Sources [1], [2], [3], and [4] all mention copper alloys used in dollar coins.
Step 4: Source [3] specifically mentions the Sacagawea dollar being made of a copper-manganese brass alloy.

Answer: The Sacagawea dollar is an example of a copper alloy dollar.

2. It predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between inequality and development.
3. Kuznets hypothesized that industrializing nations experience a rise and subsequent decline in income inequality.

...................................assistant...................................
Kuznets' curve is a hypothetical curve that graphs economic inequality against income per capita. It predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between inequality and development, meaning that inequality initially increases and then decreases as a country develops. Therefore, Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will decrease over time as a country develops.

Answer: Income inequality will decrease over time as a country develops, according to Kuznets' curve.

----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Kuznets' curve graphs economic inequality against income per capita over the course of economic development. It predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between inequality and development.

----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Kuznets' curve graphs economic inequality against income per capita over the course of economic development and predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between inequality and development. The question is asking specifically about what the curve predicts about income inequality given time, which is not explicitly stated in the context.

...................................assistant...................................
When there is low supply but high demand for a certain job, it means that there are more employers looking for workers than there are workers available.

Therefore, the type of wages that result from jobs with low supply but high demand are likely to be higher than wages for jobs with more readily available workers.

Answer: Higher wages.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

Answer: Higher wages.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

The question is asking about an act that allows whistleblowers to recover money lost from pharmaceutical fraud. The sources mention the federal False Claims Act (FCA) as the primary law protecting pharmaceutical whistleblowers. The FCA prohibits making false or fraudulent claims for the purpose of obtaining payment from the federal government. If the government prevails in a qui tam action (a lawsuit brought by a private individual on behalf of the government), the whistleblower (also known as the relator) typically receives a portion of the recovery. The FCA allows the government to recover three times its actual losses, referred to as "treble damages." Therefore, the answer is the federal False Claims Act (FCA).

Question: Which act allows whistleblowers to recover money lost from pharmaceutical fraud?

Rationale: Let's think step by step. The question is asking about an act that allows whistleblowers to recover money lost from pharmaceutical fraud. The sources mention the federal False Claims Act (FCA) as the primary law protecting pharmaceutical whistleblowers. The FCA prohibits making false or fraudulent claims for the purpose of obtaining payment from the federal government. If the government prevails in a qui tam action (a lawsuit brought by a private individual on behalf of the government), the whistleblower (also known as the relator) typically receives a portion of the recovery. The FCA allows the government to recover three times its actual losses, referred to as "treble damages." Therefore, the answer is the federal False Claims Act (FCA).

The answer can be found in sources [2] and [3], which both mention the filming of Spectre. According to [2], production began on December 8, 2014, and according to [3], principal photography concluded on July 5, 2015.

Möngke took command of the China campaign in 1257, after Subutai's death, and fate intervened to bring Mongol operations to a temporary standstill in 1241. However, Subutai's most remarkable contribution was in Europe. Therefore, Subutai's army returned to Mongolia after the Khwarezmia campaign, in 1221.

After this campaign, he returned to Mongolia where he died in 1248. He was also involved in the Mongol invasions of Russia and Eastern Europe, with a brief sortie in 1223 and a much larger campaign later on. After remaining on the steppe lands south of Russia until the end of 1223, the armies of Subutai and Jebe returned to Mongolia. Möngke himself took command of the China campaign in 1257. Subutai's most remarkable contribution was in Europe.

Answer: After the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia, Subutai's army returned to Mongolia. He died there in 1248.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................

Sources 1 and 5 mention incidents of cabin fires and fire hazards, while sources 2 and 3 provide tips on how to protect a cabin from wildfires. Source 5 also lists materials that can catch fire easily, including wood, paper, and cloth. Therefore, the materials that were likely removed to prevent more fire hazards in the future were those that were flammable.

However, source [3] specifies that he left school at age 15 without completing the compulsory curriculum, which matches the description of the Royal High School. Therefore, the answer is:

However, we do not know how many games they lost during their regular season, which is what the question is asking.

----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The Denver Broncos had a 12-4 record in 2015, according to sources [1], [5], and [6]. However, we need to exclude their playoff games to find out how many games they lost during their regular 2015 season. Source [6] indicates that they went 15 games including the playoffs, so they played three playoff games. Source [4] provides some information about their defensive performance during the playoffs, but it does not mention their regular season record. Source [2] predicts a close loss against the Patriots, but it does not give us the overall regular season record. Source [3] mentions a game against the Kansas City Chiefs, but it does not tell us whether the Broncos won or lost. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 4

Source [3] mentions a game that the Broncos lost to the Kansas City Chiefs, but it doesn't specify whether it was a regular season game or a playoff game. Source [4] mentions the Broncos' performance in their three playoff games, but again, that doesn't tell us how many regular season games they lost. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 4

Source [3] mentions a game where the Broncos lost, but it was not during the regular season. Source [4] provides information about the Broncos' performance during the playoffs, but it does not mention the regular season. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of games that the Broncos lost during their regular 2015 season.

Answer: Unknown/unclear.
