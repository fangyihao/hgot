There are several sources that mention Christopher Hitchens and his critiques. One source mentions his influence as an atheist, while another mentions his voracious reading habits. Another source mentions two of his books, and a fourth source mentions his criticisms of American foreign policy. Based on these sources, it seems likely that there may be a fact about Hitchens' critiques that stands out besides the people or topics he wrote about.

Answer: One fact that stands out about Christopher Hitchens' critiques is his sharp wit and biting writing style. He was known for his ability to skewer his opponents with clever insults and incisive arguments.

The Stardust mission collected samples of dust from the coma of comet Wild-2. The samples were brought back to Earth for analysis. The analysis showed that the outer regions of the early Solar System were not isolated and were not a refuge where interstellar materials could commonly survive. The data suggest that high-temperature inner Solar System material formed and was subsequently transferred to the Kuiper belt.

Answer: The analysis of the samples collected by the Stardust mission showed that the outer regions of the early Solar System were not isolated and were not a refuge where interstellar materials could commonly survive.

There are at least four known fish species in the Sea of Galilee, including tilapia, sardine, biny, and catfish. However, there is mention of a unique fish species that used to spawn in the marsh but has not been seen since the 1990s droughts. This suggests that there may be other fish species in the Sea of Galilee that have not been identified.
