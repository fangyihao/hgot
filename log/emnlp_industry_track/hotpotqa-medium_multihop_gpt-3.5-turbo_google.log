1. The song "Lady" was written about Lenny Kravitz's then-girlfriend.
2. We don't know the name of Kravitz's then-girlfriend, so we can't search for her birth year directly.
3. However, we can try to find out when Kravitz was in a relationship with her.
4. We don't have that information either, but we do know that "Lady" was a surprise hit from Kravitz's album, which was released in 1998.
5. Therefore, we can assume that Kravitz was in a relationship with the subject of "Lady" around that time, so we can look for women who were born around the same time as Kravitz (1964) or earlier.
6. Based on this information, we can guess that the believed subject of "Lady" was born in the 1960s or earlier.
