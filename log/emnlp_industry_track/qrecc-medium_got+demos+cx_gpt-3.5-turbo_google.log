Question: What did the other members of Future Islands, besides Cashion and Welmers, play?

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The sources mention the band members of Future Islands. We need to find out what instruments the other members besides Cashion and Welmers play.

Answer: Samuel T. Herring is the vocalist and lyricist, and Michael Lowry plays percussion.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
There are multiple sources provided that list the members of Future Islands. We need to identify which sources mention the other members besides Cashion and Welmers.

Answer: Michael Lowry played percussion and Samuel T. Herring provided lyrics and vocals.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
1. The members of Future Islands are Gerrit Welmers, William Cashion, Samuel T. Herring, and Michael Lowry (according to sources [1], [5], and [6]).
2. The question asks specifically about the other members besides Cashion and Welmers (according to the wording of the question).
3. Therefore, we need to identify which member(s) played something other than keyboards and programming (which are played by Welmers) and bass, acoustic, and electric guitars (which are played by Cashion).
4. From sources [5] and [6], we can see that Michael Lowry is listed as playing percussion, so he is the member who plays something other than what Cashion and Welmers play.

Answer: Michael Lowry played percussion in Future Islands, while Gerrit Welmers played keyboards and programming and William Cashion played bass, acoustic, and electric guitars.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
The question is asking about the other members of Future Islands besides Cashion and Welmers. We know from sources [1], [2], [4], [5], and [6] that the band comprises Gerrit Welmers on keyboards and programming and William Cashion on bass, acoustic and electric guitars. We need to find out what the other members play.

Answer: Samuel T. Herring is on lyrics and vocals, and Michael Lowry is on percussion.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Future Islands is a synth-pop band from Baltimore, Maryland. The band has been playing together for nearly 15 years. The band comprises Gerrit Welmers (keyboards and programming), William Cashion (bass, acoustic and electric guitars), Samuel T. Herring (lyrics and vocals), and Michael Lowry (percussion). From the sources, we can find out what instruments the other members besides Cashion and Welmers play.

Answer: Samuel T. Herring is the vocalist and lyricist, while Michael Lowry plays percussion.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
According to the sources, there are only two core members mentioned consistently: Gerrit Welmers and William Cashion. Other sources mention a percussionist named Michael Lowry, but it's unclear if he is a full-time member or just a touring musician. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: It's unclear which other members, if any, play in Future Islands besides Gerrit Welmers and William Cashion.
