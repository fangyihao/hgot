The question is asking about the number of receptors on a helper T cell that must be bound to a MHC:antigen complex for activation. According to the sources, primed T cells required about 40 Ag-MHC complexes to produce a significant proliferative response, whereas naive T cells required about 400 complexes. This suggests that a significant number of complexes must be bound for activation.

Answer: About 40 complexes for primed T cells, and about 400 complexes for naive T cells.
