Question: Uranium has 92 neutrons. Kindly answer with "SUPPORTS", "REFUTES", or "NOT ENOUGH INFO".

Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------
----------------------------------- CHOICE 0 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has a total of 92 protons and neutrons, so it has 92 neutrons.

Answer: SUPPORTS
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons. The number of neutrons can vary, but the statement is not specific enough to determine if it supports or refutes the claim.

Answer: NOT ENOUGH INFO
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it contains 92 protons. Neutrons can vary in isotopes, so we need to look for that information.

Answer: NOT ENOUGH INFO
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons. It also has a variable number of neutrons, but typically around 146. Therefore, it supports the statement that uranium has 92 neutrons.

Answer: SUPPORTS
----------------------------------- CHOICE 4 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium is a chemical element with atomic number 92, which means it has 92 protons and 92 electrons. Therefore, it supports the statement that uranium has 92 neutrons.

Answer: SUPPORTS
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
 Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons and 92 electrons. Neutrons are not determined by the atomic number, so there is not enough information to determine the number of neutrons in uranium.

Answer: NOT ENOUGH INFO
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons. Since the number of neutrons can vary in different isotopes of uranium, we cannot determine whether it has 92 neutrons without more specific information about the isotope.

Answer: NOT ENOUGH INFO
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, meaning it has 92 protons. Neutrons are not related to the atomic number, so we can't make a determination based on this information.

Answer: NOT ENOUGH INFO
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons. Neutrons are not part of the atomic number, so there is not enough information to determine the number of neutrons in uranium.

Answer: NOT ENOUGH INFO
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
 Uranium is a chemical element with atomic number 92, which means it has 92 protons and 92 neutrons.

Answer: SUPPORTS
----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons and 92 electrons, but the question asks about neutrons, which are not determined by the atomic number. Therefore, we do not have enough information to determine the number of neutrons in uranium.

Answer: NOT ENOUGH INFO
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium is an element with atomic number 92, so it has 92 protons and 92 neutrons in its most common isotope.

Answer: SUPPORTS
----------------------------------- CHOICE 12 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons. It also has a mass number of around 238, which means it has 238 total nucleons (protons and neutrons). Since the atomic number determines the element and the mass number determines the isotope, it supports the statement that uranium has 92 neutrons.

Answer: SUPPORTS
----------------------------------- CHOICE 13 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium is a naturally occurring element with 92 protons, so it has 92 neutrons. This fact supports the statement.

Answer: SUPPORTS
----------------------------------- CHOICE 14 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Uranium has 92 protons, so it supports the statement that it has 92 neutrons.
