Will and Dave Willis founded Bully Boy Distillers in Boston in 2010 and drew inspiration from a family tradition. Will and Dave Willis are brothers.

Eric Walters wrote a novel called "Stand Your Ground" in 1993 while teaching Grade 5 at Vista Heights Public School in Toronto.

Dave Willis, who is also a voice actor, writer, animator, producer, and musician, was born on May 1, 1970, according to his Wikipedia page.

Answer: Eric Walters was born in Toronto in 1957.

...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters is mentioned as the author of a novel called "The Bully Boys," which is not related to the Bully Boy Distillers. Dave Willis is also mentioned, but only as one of the co-creators of the Adult Swim animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies. The only mention of a birthdate is for Dave Willis, who was born on May 1, 1970. Therefore, the creator of Bully Boy is not mentioned in these sources.

Answer: N/A

...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters is not the creator of Bully Boy. Will and Dave Willis are the creators of Bully Boy Distillers, but their birth dates are not mentioned in the sources. Dave Willis' birth date is mentioned, but it is not relevant to the question.

Answer: The birth date of the creator of Bully Boy is not provided in the sources.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 5 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters wrote a novel called Stand Your Ground in 1993 while teaching Grade 5 at Vista Heights Public, according to [1]. However, this is not relevant to the question. [2] and [4] talk about Bully Boy Distillers, which is owned and operated by two brothers named Will and Dave Willis. [5] mentions that Dave Willis, one of the co-creators of the Adult Swim animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies, was born on May 1, 1970. Since [2] and [4] mention Will and Dave Willis together, it seems plausible that they are the same Willis brothers mentioned in both sources. Therefore, it is likely that the creator of Bully Boy, Dave Willis, was born on May 1, 1970.

Answer: May 1, 1970
----------------------------------- CHOICE 6 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters is mentioned in context [1], but he is not the creator of Bully Boy. Bully Boy Distillers was founded by Will and Dave Willis, who are mentioned in context [2] and [4]. However, context [5] mentions a Dave Willis who is a co-creator of Adult Swim animated series. Since context [4] mentions Will and Dave Willis as brothers who founded Bully Boy Distillers, we can assume that the Dave Willis mentioned in context [5] is not the same person as the Dave Willis who co-founded Bully Boy Distillers. Therefore, we can conclude that the creator of Bully Boy is Will or Dave Willis, but we cannot determine their birthdate from the given context.

Answer: N/A (birthdate not provided in context)
----------------------------------- CHOICE 7 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters is mentioned in [1], but he is not the creator of Bully Boy. Will and Dave Willis are mentioned as the owners and operators of Bully Boy Distillers in [2] and [4], but their birth years are not provided. Dave Willis is mentioned in [5], but he is not the creator of Bully Boy either. However, [3] mentions "Roosevelt's toothy grin, outsized personality, colossal energy, and fascinating" and refers to him as "Bully Boy". Therefore, the question likely refers to Theodore Roosevelt and his birth year.

Answer: 1858 (Theodore Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858)
----------------------------------- CHOICE 8 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters wrote Stand Your Ground in 1993 while teaching Grade 5 at a Toronto public school. The book has nothing to do with Bully Boy. Bully Boy Distillers is a craft distillery founded in Boston in 2010 by two brothers, Will and Dave Willis. However, the Bully Boy referred to in historian Jim Powell's book is Theodore Roosevelt. Dave Willis, co-creator of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies, was born on May 1, 1970, but this fact is irrelevant to the question. Therefore, the answer is: Eric Walters was born in Toronto in 1957.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters wrote a novel called "Stand Your Ground" in 1993 while teaching Grade 5. He was born in Toronto in 1957. Bully Boy Distillers was founded in 2010 by two brothers named Will and Dave Willis. Dave Willis, one of the co-creators of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies, was born on May 1, 1970. None of this information provides the answer to the question "When was the creator of Bully Boy born?" directly, but we do know that the context is discussing different people associated with Bully Boy, so we can deduce that the creator of Bully Boy is either Will Willis or Dave Willis. According to context [4], Will and Dave Willis are brothers who founded Bully Boy Distillers, so Dave Willis must be the creator of Bully Boy. Context [5] provides Dave Willis's birthdate as May 1, 1970.

Answer: May 1, 1970

...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters was born in Toronto in 1957. He wrote his first novel, Stand Your Ground (1993), while teaching Grade 5 at Vista Heights Public School. However, Eric Walters is not the creator of Bully Boy. Looking at the other sources, we find that Bully Boy Distillers was founded in 2010 by two brothers, Will and Dave Willis. Dave Willis, one of the co-creators of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies, was born on May 1, 1970. Therefore, the answer is: 1970. 

Answer: 1970.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 11 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters wrote a novel called Stand Your Ground in 1993 while teaching Grade 5 at Vista Heights Public, but there is no mention of Bully Boy. Bully Boy Distillers was founded in Boston in 2010 by two brothers named Will and Dave Willis, who found their inspiration for making small-batch spirits through a local tradition and deep-rooted family history. However, it is not clear if either of them is the creator of Bully Boy mentioned in the third source. Dave Willis is an American voice actor, writer, animator, producer, and musician, but it is also not clear if he is the creator of Bully Boy mentioned in the third source. Lastly, the third source mentions a historian named Jim Powell who wrote a book called Bully Boy about Theodore Roosevelt's legacy. However, there is no indication that he is the creator of Bully Boy mentioned in the second source. Therefore, we cannot determine when the creator of Bully Boy was born based on the given sources.

Answer: Cannot be determined.

Eric Walters wrote a novel called "Stand Your Ground" in 1993 while teaching Grade 5. One of the sources mentions "Bully Boy Distillers" in Boston, founded in 2010 and owned by two brothers named Will and Dave Willis. Another source talks about a book called "Bully Boy" that discusses the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt. Finally, one of the sources mentions Dave Willis, who is a voice actor, writer, animator, producer, and musician known for co-creating the Adult Swim animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies. None of these sources provide information about the birth year of Eric Walters, but one of the sources mentions Dave Willis's birth year as May 1, 1970.

Eric Walters wrote a novel called "Stand Your Ground" while teaching in Toronto in 1993. The question asks for the birth year of the creator of Bully Boy, but there are multiple sources related to Bully Boy. However, source [2] mentions that Bully Boy Distillers was founded in 2010 by two brothers named Will and Dave Willis. Source [5] provides the birthdate of a Dave Willis who is a co-creator of the Adult Swim animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies and was born on May 1, 1970.

...................................assistant...................................
Eric Walters wrote the novel "The Bully Boys" and was born in 1957, but this may not necessarily be related to the creation of Bully Boy Distillers. Will and Dave Willis are the owners and operators of Bully Boy Distillers, but they are not necessarily the creators. Dave Willis, who is mentioned in the sources, is a co-creator of the Adult Swim animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies, but this may not necessarily relate to Bully Boy. However, source [4] states that Will and Dave Willis found their inspiration for making small-batch spirits through a local tradition and a deep-rooted family history. Therefore, it is likely that the creator of Bully Boy was one or both of the Willis brothers, who were inspired by their family history.

Answer: The creator of Bully Boy is likely one or both of the Willis brothers, who were inspired by their family history.
