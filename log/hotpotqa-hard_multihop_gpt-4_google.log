First, we need to identify the organization mentioned in the question. The clues are that it has a Center for Veterinary Medicine and is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This refers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Next, we need to find out how much was spent by the FDA in 2017. According to source [1], the FDA's budget in 2017 was $596 million.

From source [2] and [4], we can see that the Panther tank is also known as the PzKpfw V, which matches the "Mark V" designation mentioned in the question. The same sources also confirm that the Panther tank was used on both the Eastern and Western fronts from mid-1943, which aligns with the timeframe given in the question. Finally, source [3] states that the Panther tank provided the armor and suspension for a tank destroyer built by Nazi Germany during World War II.

From source [4], we can see that Marissa Jaret Winokur was cast as the lead character of Tracy Turnblad. However, the question asks for the middle name of the actress, which is not provided in the source.

First, we know from the question that we are looking for a singer-songwriter who has written for several country acts and achieved a No. 1 single with "Always and Forever". From source [3], we can see that "Forever and Ever, Amen" is a song from the album "Always & Forever" and was written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz. Since the question asks for a single songwriter, we can deduce that one of these two is the correct answer. However, the question also mentions that this person has written for Randy Travis, Blake Shelton, and Keith Whitley. Since the sources do not provide information on who among the two wrote for these artists, we cannot definitively answer the question.

First, we need to identify the school district that has Henry L. Grishman as its superintendent. From source [2], we can see that Henry L. Grishman is the Superintendent of Schools for the Jericho School District. Therefore, we can exclude Jericho School District from our search. Next, we need to find another school district near Hauppauge Union Free School District. From source [4], we can see that Commack Union Free School District and Smithtown Central School District are mentioned as school districts in Hauppauge. Since Syosset Central and Half Hollow Hills Central are already mentioned in the question, we can exclude them from our options. Therefore, the remaining school district near Hauppauge Union Free School District is either Commack Union Free School District or Smithtown Central School District.

First, we need to identify the female American singer born in 1954. Both Marilyn Martin and Angela Bofill fit this description. However, the question also mentions that her third studio album was named "Through His Eyes". None of the sources provided mention this album, so we can't determine which singer it refers to. However, the question also mentions a hit duet in 1985. According to source [1], Marilyn Martin had a hit duet with Phil Collins in 1985. Therefore, Phil Collins is the male singer who performed the duet.

First, we need to identify the key figure who was drafted 18th overall pick for the New Jersey Nets. From the sources, we can see that Lonnie Walker IV was the 18th overall pick. However, the team is not mentioned. We also know from the sources that Mark Jackson was the 18th overall pick for the New York Knicks, not the New Jersey Nets. Therefore, we can deduce that the key figure is Lonnie Walker IV. Next, we need to identify the university he attended. From the sources, we can see that Lonnie Walker IV played basketball at Alvernia University. Therefore, we can conclude that Lonnie Walker IV attended Alvernia University before being drafted 18th overall pick for the New Jersey Nets.

First, we know from sources [1] and [2] that the brutal pro-Confederate guerrilla leader is "Bloody Bill" Anderson. Then, from source [3], we learn that Jesse Woodson James, a bank and train robber, rode with Anderson. The same source also tells us that James was born near Centerville, which is present-day Kearney, Missouri. Therefore, we can deduce that James, who followed Anderson, was raised in the area of Kearney, Missouri.

Next, we need to find out which singer, who auditioned for "Junior Junction" and landed a recording contract in her teens, toured with Chuck Berry.

The question is asking for the number of episodes in the 23rd season of a show that aired on the Fox network. The show is not directly named in the question, but it is implied to be "The Simpsons" because the 21st episode of the 22nd season, which was written by John Frink and directed by Bob Anderson, is mentioned. This episode is from "The Simpsons," as indicated in the sources. Therefore, we need to find the number of episodes in the 23rd season of "The Simpsons." According to source [4], the 23rd season of "The Simpsons" had 22 episodes.

First, we need to identify the source that mentions algebraic rules or quantities "a" and "b" with "a" > "b" > 0. Source [1] mentions a linear equation with one variable, x, and the standard form ax+b=0 where a and b are real numbers and a≠0. However, it does not specify that "a" > "b" > 0. Source [2] also mentions the symbols a, b, but does not provide any specific rule or condition for these quantities. Source [3] does not seem to mention any algebraic rules or quantities "a" and "b". Source [4] mentions subscripts B and B/ on the columns of numbers, but this does not seem to be related to the question. Therefore, none of the provided sources seem to contain a book that is centered around a rule that is expressed algebraically, or quantities "a" and "b" with "a" > "b" > 0.

First, we know from the question that we're looking for an opening phrase of a soliloquy spoken by Prince Hamlet in Shakespeare's play "Hamlet". The context [2] mentions that "To be, or not to be" is the opening phrase of a speech given by Prince Hamlet. This matches the information we're looking for, so it's likely that "To be, or not to be" is the phrase that refers to the afterlife as the "undiscovered country".

From the first source, we know that David Wayne Hull is a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. The second source tells us that Samuel Bowers, who was also a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, co-founded the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Since the question asks for a group that originated in Mississippi in the early 1960s under the leadership of Samuel Bowers, we can deduce that David Wayne Hull is a leader of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

First, we know from the question that the radio play is about an Irish novelist. From source [4], we learn that Brian O'Nolan, also known as Flann O'Brien, was an Irish novelist. The question also mentions that the novelist wrote many satirical columns. From source [3], we learn that Brian O'Nolan wrote under many pseudonyms, the most famous two being Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Therefore, it is likely that the name under which the novelist wrote his satirical columns is one of these pseudonyms.

The name "Calibraska" appears to be a combination of two names. The first part, "Cali," is likely short for California, as it is a common abbreviation for the state. The second part, "braska," is likely referring to Nebraska, as it is the only U.S. state with a name ending in "braska." This is further supported by the context provided, which mentions the Calibraska Arts Initiative as a cultural exchange between California and Nebraska.

First, we need to identify the correct film. The question refers to "The Deal," a 2015 South Korean crime thriller directed by Son Yong-ho. This information is confirmed in source [1]. The question also mentions that the film features actor Park Sung-woong as a serial killer. However, none of the provided sources mention Park Sung-woong in relation to "The Deal." This could be an oversight, or it could mean that the actor is not in this particular film. Regardless, the question asks for the name of the book that the film is based on. Source [2] mentions a different film, "Memoir of a Murderer," which is based on a book, but this is not the film we are interested in. Source [3] mentions a webcomic called "Georae" that a drama called "The Deal" is based on, but this is also not the film we are interested in. Source [4] does not provide any new information. Therefore, based on the provided sources, we do not have enough information to determine the name of the book that the 2015 film "The Deal" is based on.

David Tennant and Steve Coogan have both played the character Phileas Fogg in different versions of "Around the World in 80 Days". However, the question is asking about a 1939 film, which is much earlier than either of these actors' careers. Therefore, we need to find out who played Phileas Fogg in a version of "Around the World in 80 Days" that was around in 1939.

First, we need to identify the actor who played Phileas Fogg in "Around the World in 80 Days". From the sources, we can see that David Tennant, Steve Coogan, and David Niven have all played this role in different versions of the film. However, the question refers to a 1939 film, so we need to identify the actor who would have been active during that time. From the sources, David Niven is the only actor who fits this timeline. Therefore, we need to find a 1939 film starring David Niven and Gary Cooper. Unfortunately, the sources provided do not contain this information. We would need to look up additional information to answer this question.

George VI became king after the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII. Edward VIII had a short reign of 326 days. However, the question asks about a king who became king after the death of his younger brother, not after his abdication. Therefore, neither George VI nor Edward VIII are the answer to the question. We need to find a king who became king after the death of his younger brother and whose reign was marked by rivalry with relatives.

...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify the king who became king after the death of his younger brother. From source [1], we know that George VI became king after the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII. However, the question specifies that the king in question became king after the death of his younger brother, not abdication. Therefore, George VI is not the correct answer. 

Next, we look at source [4], which tells us that John was King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216. However, it does not specify whether he became king after the death of his younger brother. 

Finally, we look at source [3], which tells us that Henry II was King of England from 1154 until his death in 1189. However, it does not specify whether he became king after the death of his younger brother. 

Without additional information, we cannot definitively answer the question. However, based on the information provided, the most likely answer is John, as source [4] indicates that his reign was marked by loss and conflict, which could be interpreted as "chaotic due to rivalry with relatives."
