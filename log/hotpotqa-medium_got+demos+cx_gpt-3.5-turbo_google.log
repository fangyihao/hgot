Both churches are located in Istanbul, Turkey, and are dedicated to Mary. However, this may not be unique to these two churches. Let's look for more specific similarities.

However, the Church of St. Mary of the Spring is known for its nearby holy spring with healing properties, while there is no mention of such a feature at Hagia Irene.

Both churches are located in Istanbul, so they may have other similarities. Let's look at their histories. The Church of St. Mary of the Spring is named after a nearby holy spring with healing properties, while the Church of Mary of the Blachernae was popular with the court and common people and became a pilgrimage destination. These similarities suggest that both churches may have been important religious sites in Istanbul.

...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify what Hagia Irene is. It is a former Eastern Orthodox church located in Istanbul, Turkey. Now, we need to compare it to the Church of St. Mary of the Spring and see if they have anything in common. According to [1], the Church of St. Mary of the Spring is named after a nearby holy spring with healing properties. According to [2], the Church of Mary of the Blachernae and the Maphorion was also a popular destination of pilgrimage. Therefore, it is likely that both churches were considered holy places with healing or spiritual properties.

Answer: Both the Church of St. Mary of the Spring and Hagia Irene were considered holy places with healing or spiritual properties.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 9 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
First, we need to identify what Hagia Irene is. It is a former Eastern Orthodox church located in Istanbul, Turkey. Next, we can look at the two sources provided and see if they mention any connection between Hagia Irene and the Church of St. Mary of the Spring or the Church of Mary of the Blachernae and the Maphorion. However, neither source mentions any connection between the three churches.
