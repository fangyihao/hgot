Rationale: Let's think step by step.
----------------------------------- RESPONSE -----------------------------------

...................................assistant...................................
[1] The context mentions ZARA, a clothing brand known for selling dresses.
[2] The context also mentions H&M, another clothing brand known for selling dresses.
[3] However, there is no mention of lululemon, so it is unlikely that either ZARA or H&M would have information about the price of a lululemon Align Dress.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] The context mentions ZARA and their dresses.
[2] The context mentions H&M and their dresses.
[3] The question asks for the price of the lululemon Align Dress.

Based on the given information, neither ZARA nor H&M are relevant sources to find the price of the lululemon Align Dress.

Answer: No
----------------------------------- CHOICE 2 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] The context does not mention anything about lululemon or the Align Dress.
[2] The context does not mention anything about lululemon or the Align Dress.
[3] There is no additional information or context provided.

Answer: Unable to determine the price of the lululemon Align Dress.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 3 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
[1] The first source is from ZARA, which is not likely to provide information about lululemon products.
[2] The second source is from H&M, which also does not provide information about lululemon products.

Since neither of the sources mentioned is relevant to lululemon products, it is unlikely that we can find the price of the lululemon Align Dress from these sources.

Answer: Not available.
