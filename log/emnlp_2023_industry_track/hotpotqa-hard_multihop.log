The conflict between the settlers of New Netherland and the Lenape population was known as Kieft's War or the Wappinger War. The war lasted from 1643-1645 and was named after Director-General Willem Kieft, who ordered an attack without approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists. The war was extremely bloody in proportion to the population at the time, with more than 1,600 natives killed. Kieft was recalled to the Netherlands to answer for his conduct in 1647, but he died in a shipwreck before his version of events could be told.

[1] «Kieft's War | Kieft's War Kieft's War, also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict (1643–1645) between settlers of the nascent colony of New Netherland and the native Lenape population in what would later become the New York metropolitan area of the United States. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists. Dutch soldiers attacked Lenape camps and massacred the native inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch, and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.

The war was extremely bloody in proportion to the population at the time: more than 1,600 natives were killed at a time when the European population of New Amsterdam was only 250.

One small German group actually succeeded in breaking into the northwestern corner of the British defensive square, but they were quickly killed.

The Australian official history of the war claimed that this was the first "kamikaze" attack on an Allied ship, although other sources disagree because it was not a planned attack by a member of the Special Attack Force, but was most likely to have been undertaken on the pilot's own initiative.
