...................................assistant...................................
Step 1: The question asks for the name of a Norwegian football club from the town of Kristiansand.
Step 2: The club was promoted from Adeccoligaen in 2012, so they must have been in that league in 2011.
Step 3: The club played against Viking in the 2011 La Manga Cup, so they must have been in Tippeligaen in 2011.
Step 4: The only Tippeligaen club from Kristiansand is identified in source [4] as having been promoted in 2004 and finishing second in 2005.
Step 5: The name of the club is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that it is the only club from Kristiansand currently playing in Tippeligaen.

Step 6: According to source [5], the only other Tippeligaen club from Kristiansand is currently playing at Sparebanken Sør Arena.

...................................assistant...................................
The question asks about the frequency of trains on a particular system. The system has a terminal station located in the Herald Square neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, at the intersection of 32nd Street and Sixth Avenue. The sources mention different stations and lines, but they all seem to be part of the same subway system in New York City. We can assume that the frequency of trains would be mentioned in one of the sources, either as a schedule or as a general statement about the system.

The question is asking about the frequency of trains on a specific system that has a terminal station located in Herald Square. We know from [1] that the 34th Street-Herald Square station is located on the BMT Broadway Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. From [3] we know that the 33rd Street Station is part of the PATH system and is a terminal station, but it is not located at Herald Square. However, from [4] we know that trains departing Hoboken on the PATH system come to a junction that allows a choice of destinations: 33rd Street or Newport. Therefore, the PATH system does not run trains to the station located in Herald Square. From [5], we know that the N train stops at 34th Street-Herald Square, but we don't know the frequency of trains. 

Answer: The frequency of trains running on the system which has a terminal station located at the intersection of 32nd Street and Sixth Avenue in the Herald Square neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City is not provided in the given sources.

----------------------------------- CHOICE 10 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
Answer: The question is asking about the frequency of trains on a specific subway line that has a terminal station at Herald Square. The sources mention several subway lines and stations in the area, but the 34th Street-Herald Square station is mentioned in [1] and [5], and [3] mentions a PATH station at 33rd Street which is nearby. The question doesn't specify which subway line or train type, so we can't give a definitive answer, but [5] mentions the N subway line which stops at 34th Street-Herald Square, and [4] mentions PATH trains departing from Hoboken with a choice of destinations including 33rd Street. So depending on the specific train line and time of day, trains may run every few minutes or every hour.

We also know that Season 14 of the show had 22 episodes, but that doesn't help us answer the question.

The question asks for the number of episodes in the 23rd season of a Fox network show. We know that the show in question aired its 21st episode in its 22nd season, but we don't have the name of the show.

Therefore, the answer is:

The question is asking about the 23rd season of a Fox network show. We know from [2] that the 23rd season of The Simpsons aired during the 2011-12 United States network television schedule. We also know from [1] that "500 Keys" was the twenty-first episode of the twenty-second season of The Simpsons. Therefore, the 23rd season of The Simpsons is not the season that aired "500 Keys". We need to look for the number of episodes in the 23rd season. [2] states that the 23rd season began on September 25, but does not give the number of episodes. We need to keep looking. [3] states that the 14th season had 22 episodes, so that is not the answer. [4] talks about the 29th season, so we need to keep looking. Finally, [5] mentions the renewals for several shows, including The Simpsons, and states that it will have a record-setting 35th and 36th seasons. Therefore, the number of episodes in the 23rd season of The Simpsons is not given in these sources.

3. From source [1], we know that Nixon was President from 1969-1974, so the re-election must have taken place before 1969.
4. From sources [2] and [3], we learn that John F. Kennedy defeated Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, which means Nixon was not re-elected to the Senate in 1960.
5. From source [4], we see that there was a senator who became president in 1920, but this is too early to be relevant to the question.
6. Therefore, the answer must be a year between 1961 and 1968, when Nixon was not serving as vice president or president. We do not have enough information to determine the exact year.

Step 3: Source [2] mentions Henry II of England, who controlled England at various points in his life and was crowned in 1154. However, the question specifies that the king became king after the death of his younger brother, and Henry II had an older brother who died before him.

Step 4: Source [3] mentions Edward the Confessor, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, who died in 1066 and had conflicting claims to the throne. However, he did not have a younger brother who succeeded him.

Step 5: Source [4] mentions Henry II again, who inherited the throne after the death of King Stephen, but as mentioned earlier, he did not become king after the death of a younger brother.
