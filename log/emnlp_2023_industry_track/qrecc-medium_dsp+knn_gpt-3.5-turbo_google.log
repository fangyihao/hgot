[1] Plastids are organelles found in the cells of plants, algae, and some other eukaryotic organisms. 
[2] Plastids are present in both plant and animal cells according to one source, but only in plants according to another source.
[3] However, other sources specify that plant cells have plastids while animal cells do not.
[4] Additionally, one source explains that plastids used for storage are found in plant cells, but not in animal cells.
[5] Another source explains that plastids are absent in animals because they are mobile organisms that can move around to obtain nutrients and energy.
[6] Finally, a source claims that plastids are found in plant cells, but not in animal cells, and that there are three types of plastids: chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplast.

Answer: Plastids are present in plant cells, but not in animal cells.
----------------------------------- CHOICE 1 -----------------------------------
...................................assistant...................................
