The question is asking about a proposed constitutional change. The sources mention that many amendments are proposed during each session of Congress, but we need to narrow it down to a specific one. Source [2] mentions the Twentieth Amendment, which was proposed in 1932 and adopted in 1933. Source [3] provides more information about the Twentieth Amendment, stating that it moved the beginning and ending of terms for the president, vice president, and members of Congress. Source [4] confirms this information and provides the exact dates for when these terms end. Therefore, the constitutional change that was considered was the Twentieth Amendment, which moved the beginning and ending of terms for elected officials.

The sources mention that Huguenots fled France due to persecution by the Catholic government. They then created settlements all over Europe, the United States, and Africa. The sources also mention that the bulk of Huguenot emigres moved to Protestant states such as the Dutch Republic, England, and Wales, as well as Protestant-controlled Ireland. Therefore, the first two destinations of Huguenot emigres were likely the Dutch Republic and England.

The question asks for the year of the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary show. According to [4], the 40th Anniversary special is ranked fourth among all the anniversary specials. Therefore, it must have happened before the 50th Anniversary special, which aired in 2013. So, the answer must be a year between 1963 and 2013, but after 2003 (which was the 40th Anniversary of the show's first episode).
